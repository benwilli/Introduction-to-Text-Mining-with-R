their present form DISRAELI say that it would be very inconvenient at that hour to commence the discussion upon that Vote because it could only lead to the debate be adjourn and if the Government could give them after a certain hour it would be far more agreeable and there would be he be convince a much progress make under those circumstance a under any other He hop that the right Gentleman at the head of the Government would make some conciliatory statement upon that matter because it could hardly be suppose that that Vote would be agree to sub The proposal that the discussion should be take upon the Supplementary Vote could hardly be make except in ridicule for the prospect of be able to deal with so large a question upon a Supplementary Vote in Committee be not encourage It have be state early in the evening that the attention of the Committee of Supply would first be draw to the Votes connect with the Navy and it would be therefore like postpone to the Greek any serious discussion upon the Irish Education Vote He hop therefore that the Government would at all event meet them upon that question and they would endeavour to condense their observation as much a possible GLADSTONE say he would agree that the present occasion be not the most convenient mode of take the debate but the and learn Member for Dublin have give Notice that he would deliver his statement upon the Report of the Vote and therefore it rest with that and learn Gentleman to do so or not a he should think fit There be certainly nothing like ridicule intend because the Chairman of the Committee have declare that the discussion could be take in Committee His objection to divide the Morning Sitting between the Ballot Bill and the Irish Education Vote be two first that as regard that which be say to be mark out a the special subject of discussion namely the provision make by Government with respect to the National School teachers the Irish Education Vote be not urgent in point of time and secondly he do not think that to divide the Morning Sitting would be a good method for secure progress either with the Ballot Bill or the Irish Education Vote He do not at all agree in the observation about the Greek and he could only say that the Government would do all that they could to promote the dispatch of Public Business They would wait to hear whether the and learn Gentleman be dispose now to make his statement though he think the best course would be to adhere to the understanding come to on a former evening and take the general debate when the Supplementary Vote be propose in Committee The time of the Committee could not now be fix because it be necessary to make progress with the Ballot Bill and when they do reach Supply the Naval Vote would be the one with which it would be proper in the first instance to proceed say that it be with the utmost reluctance that he must trespass upon the House at that late hour but he have no choice Many person interested in the Irish Education Vote have be long look forward to an opportunity to discuss the whole question There be an increase in the sum to be vote for school teacher not to raise the salary of the teacher but to meet certain additional expense Two or three year ago a Royal Commission be appoint to inquire into the question of primary education in Ireland That Commission bring up it Report early in the year Amongst the many valuable topic refer to be those connect with the status and payment of the National School teacher Now there be great hardship in the present position of those teacher A deputation at considerable expense from Ireland wait upon the right Gentleman at the head of the Government on this subject but although the member of it be courteously receive by the right Gentleman nothing come out of it Questions be over and over again ask in that House in reference to that subject but the invariable answer give to them be that the time for consider them be when the Estimates relate to Irish education come on for consideration Well the Estimates do come on at length but not until on a Saturday morning when the House be utterly exhaust after a most fatiguing week business The recommendation of the Commissioners be very numerous and amongst them be these namely that the pay of the National School teacher be wholly insufficient to secure the best candidate and the most efficient teacher and that it ought to be raise that there should be three class of teacher the first class of male teacher the second and the third that there should be a desirable residence in each of those school for teacher of the first class such residence to be rent free the ordinary repair of it to be make by the teacher themselves but the permanent repair to be effect by the locality that the power of appoint and dismiss those teacher should be in the hand of the local manager and that a a condition of State aid the manager should enter into a contract with the teacher specify his duty and emolument and contain a provision that the engagement should be terminable on three month notice give by either party He submit that that be a question of enormous and serious importance and therefore it demand the immediate consideration of the Government and Parliament The Commissioners far report that a regard the second and third class of teacher the wage give them be very little above that of the labour man The only addition make by the Government to the salary of those men be a miserable which be confine to the teacher and those of the second and the first class receive not even that paltry amount while the noble Lord the Chief Secretary moreover have not take the least notice of the recommendation of the Commissioners concern their residence their pension or their status in case of dismissal He have no alternative but to bring the question on at that unreasonable hour of the night a no other opportunity would be afford him by the Government but he could not help say that the Government ought to state their intention more fully and the House ought to have an opportunity of fully debate them It be not his desire to diminish the present Vote On the contrary he desire to add a little more to it in order that something like adequate compensation might be give to those unfortunate teacher SIR FREDERICK say he be sorry to take a course that would appear a if he oppose the Board of National Education in Ireland but there would be no opportunity of discuss that question after that night He believe the Government desire to see the position of the National School teacher improve but there be other matter that require consideration such a the management or control of the school It be only reasonable that the teacher should have due notice before they be discharge but they go too far when they ask to be consider a civil servant and without the control of the Board He regret the small amount of local interest that be felt on the subject from the amount of local contribution amount only to per cent leave per cent to be contribute by the State In Ulster there appear to be more local support give to them than in the other Provinces in Ireland The proposal of the Government to increase the remuneration of the teacher would create unpleasant feeling amongst the other two class above them The total number of child attend the school be return at a remarkable fact when it be say this system of education have fail The increase of in the number of scholar and only an increase of attendance lead him to doubt the accuracy of the figure The proposal of payment by result be not fully understand by the teacher and with regard to the Rule that any change in the Rules of the House should be lay on the Table of the House before they become law that would have the effect of give confidence in the national system of education in Ireland He would suggest the postponement of the Vote in order that a good scheme of remuneration might be devise for the teacher THE MARQUESS OF say he quite agree that it be necessary to increase the salary of teacher The Government however do not think that the recommendation of the Commissioners could be discuss in the present Session It be impossible that the Government could deal comprehensively and finally with these recommendation without deal with the subject of Irish education a a whole The and learn Gentleman have omit to inform the House that the Commissioners state that in their opinion the whole of the proposed increase in the salary of the teacher should not be pay by the State Such a question and the proposal of a national rate in aid would evidently raise the whole subject of Irish education The Government propose therefore to postpone the subject till next year and the Queen Speech notify that that course would be take It be not likely that the proposal now make would satisfy the teacher but the Government do not put forward that a a final settlement No doubt much yet remain to be do in order to ameliorate the status and pay of the teacher but that be in great part the fault of the Irish people for it be always contemplate that local source should contribute towards the teacher salaries The proposal of the Government be a temporary one and he hop Members would be prepare to discuss it a such upon the Supplementary Intimate say the teacher consider that the most obnoxious part of the regulation affect them be the arbitrary managerial control to which they be now subject and he regret that the noble Lord the Chief Secretary for Ireland have not find time to deal with it Some of them have present a Petition to the right Gentleman at the head of the Government on that and other point What satisfaction be it to them to be tell that the Government have the subject under consideration and would perhaps deal with their grievance in the next Session DOWNING say he be relieve to hear from the noble Lord the Chief Secretary for Ireland that his present proposal be not put forward a a final measure of justice to that deserve class of person MAGUIRE say that notwithstanding the declaration of the right Gentleman at the head of the Government the Catholics of Ireland be determine to impress on every Government of every party that an education base on religion be most in accordance with their feeling and wish"

interested in it fate It be a Bill of cost which would impose heavy burden on the Irish metropolis and he appeal in sober seriousness to his Colleague and ask him how he could reconcile it to his feeling a one of the representative of the city of Dublin to force on his constituent so extravagant and unconstitutional a measure If he Reynolds possess the concentrated eloquence of both side of the House it would be impossible for him adequately to describe it monstrosity or to designate it true character It would abolish municipal right and transfer the tax power of a responsible corporation to a number of ex officio commissioner He think that when such a measure be support by his Colleague who on this occasion appear to be an instrument in the hand of a speculate attorney it be the duty of the right Baronet the Secretary for Ireland to lead the opposition to it but a that course have not be pursue by any of Her Majesty Ministers he Reynolds felt justified in come forward and move that the Bill be read a second time that day six month SIR say that two or three day ago he have receive a letter to the effect that this matter have be arrange that the three Dublin Bills which now stand for second reading would be withdraw and that the Government would introduce a general measure which would satisfy the wish of all party He wish to ask the right Baronet the Secretary for Ireland whether this information be correct SIR SOMERVILLE regret that he be unable to give so satisfactory an answer to the question a he could desire He could assure the House that Her Majesty Ministers be exceedingly anxious that the disagreement between the party in Dublin relative to the three Bills in question should be settle and that they should come to some sort of compromise with each other He have be in hope the day before that he should be able now to make an announcement that the dispute be end but he be sorry to say that one of the party be not dispose to withdraw their Bill At the same time he be not without hope even still that there be a possibility of an amicable conclusion be arrive at on the subject observe that he would not oppose this proposition provide the

give any assurance that such a suggestion a this would be adopt by Her Majesty Ministers WILSON PATTEN think the proposal of his Friend the Member for Devonshire be a very excellent one that the three Dublin Bills should under the circumstance be postpone for three week deny that there be any job or injustice contemplate by the Bill the best proof of which be that all he ask the House to do be to refer the Bill to a Committee to inquire into it merit and if then it be find to contain audacious or tyrannical clause he for one should be quite ready to abandon them whereas the opponent of the measure shrank from the Committee oppose the second reading of the measure and state that the citizen of Dublin be almost unanimously averse to it provision He denounce the Bill a be monstrous and impolitic and declare that it be the scheme of a speculate solicitor to obtain cost SIDNEY HERBERT believe that the House have become heartily sick of this subject These Bills have be postpone in order that Government might ascertain whether such alteration could be introduce in them a to enable it to support them He apprehend that the Government have no great favour for of the Bills An influential meeting have recently take place in Dublin from which it appear that the Irish Government the Lord Mayor and the Chamber of Commerce of Dublin be in favour of the withdrawal of the Bills in order that the subject might be undertake by the Government If the Government be dispose to take up this subject and he think that they ought to do so a the subject matter of the Bill be one which ought to be deal with by the Government and not by private individual he consider that the course propose by the Baronet Sir be a prudent one He trust that the Government be in earnest in this matter and that they would take themselves take the initiative SIR SOMERVILLE repeat what he have say before that the Government be perfectly in earnest in desire to bring the to a satisfactory termination and that he be not without hope that an amicable settlement be near at hand say that the right Gentleman the Member for Wiltshire who support the present Bill be an Irish absentee landlord that no portion of the burden of taxation in Dublin fell upon his shoulder and that he do nothing in the country but most scrupulously receive his rent The question before the House be whether they would uphold Jackson the attorney who be the solitary promoter of the measure or the interest of the citizen of Dublin HAMILTON state that a good landlord than the right Member for Wiltshire do not exist REYNOLDS say that if a postponement of the second reading for a fortnight be assent to he would not put the House to the trouble of proceed to a division SIR have no objection to substitute a

114714	"TRADES UNIONS._1903"	"BELL Derby on a point of order desire to know whether the Motion would be in order see that there be a Bill down for a future day deal with the same subject SPEAKER say he be about to call the Member attention to the fact there be several Bills on this subject and a the Motion be couch in wide term he be about to ask the Member what matter outside the scope of these Bills he propose to discuss and whether he would modify his Motion so a not to include their Sunderland say he do not intend to trench upon those Bills in the observation he propose to make but it certainly seem to him there be ground for some inquiry SPEAKER say it be not enough in order to avoid anticipate a Bill for the Member to contend that the question which be raise by a Bill be one on which there should be previous inquiry The Gentleman must avoid all discussion on the of those Pills If the Gentleman say he could make his Motion without touch the of those Bills that be another matter say that be his impression The position he have take up have be misunderstood and he have be meet with a good deal of opposition from opposite quarter Those who represent the employer consider he be bring a Motion which might injure their view of the law whilst Members who represent Trades Unions think he be try to discussion on the Bills which would come before the House in due time He should he think be able to show good reason for ask the House to agree that a Committee should be appoint to inquire into the state of the law a it affect Trades Unions without attempt to allude to any of the point to which the Bill of the right Member for Forest of Dean and others allude His first point be that the legal status obtain by Trades Unions be of great importance to the country and to the House quite irrespective of party Everybody who know anything of social and economic life in this country look upon it a a matter of great importance to the country that Trades Unions should not be in the uncertain position that they be in Trades Unions have become more and more important from time to time and have now obtain a status Then come the great combination of employer Considering the importance of trade in this country and the fact that the whole prosperity of the country depend upon the operation of trade and that that be involve in the relation of the Trades Unions and the Employers Unions it seem to him that that be good reason for ask for an inquiry to settle what exactly be the position of the law if there be a law with regard to Trades Unions The three ground on which he base his request be first the uncertainty a to the liability of Unions and a to what they could do as well a the uncertainty of the right of Employers Unions That in itself he think justify his request for inquiry Such inquiry would be in the interest of the general public as much a of the combination themselves Secondly he urge the inequality of the position of Trades Unions and Employers Unions a a reason for inquiry That inequality be not only possible with regard to their legal position but also from their general position He point out that in case of dispute the workman risk more than the employer because the employer could shift their business and get rid of the difficulty in that way but that this course be not open to the Trades Unions The chief ground on which he have base his argument be the natural and broad one of public policy Trades Unions be a very important body in the country Everything he think should be do as far a reasonably could to consider their position and all that the country or the House could desire be that they should obey the law It would surely be a wise course to try to make their position clear In ask for an inquiry he could not see that he be in any way ask for an amendment of the law He only ask for an inquiry into the state of the law a it be and he hop the Government would show favour to such an inquiry He beg to move in rise to second the Motion congratulate his friend on the extremely skilful way in which he have propose it He himself felt the sword of Damocles suspend by a hair over his head and a sense of extreme peril in the task he have undertake in second the Motion He contend that the general law relate to Trades Unions be in a crude condition It be law make by the Judges rather than by the House He be far from wish to be understand to object to what be call law for some of the law be of the very best we have He instance the Merchant Law make not only by judge but jury a well and the Law of Partnerships which be make in a like manner from time to time until at last it reach a stage a the result of an inquiry by a Committee of this House when it be possible to legislate upon it The difficulty the House be in when it approach legislation which relate to labour lay in the uncertainty of the material It be essential that there should be before the House some clear view of what the law be before they could possibly proceed effectively to amend it Therefore it be eminently desirable to his mind that the Government should initiate some form of inquiry on this subject Speaking for himself he think the Government would probably act wisely in go a little short of this Motion if they confine themselves to ask for a report on the actual state of thing rather than for suggestion a to a remedy He would prefer that an inquiry of this sort should be conduct in a dry scientific light which could only be do by those engage divest themselves of the very small tinge of opinion on one side or the other and he submit to the House that the condition of thing with which they be all familiar make it essential and desirable that they should have some authoritative statement a to the material with which they have to deal He beg leave to second the Motion Motion make and Question propose That a Committee be appoint to inquire into the exist law a it affect Trades Unions and report what if any alteration should be make therein Mr GALLOWAY Manchester I acknowledge at once the difficulty in which I be place in follow two such eminent Members of the Bar That difficulty be almost insurmountable and I rise not so much to discuss in any way the merit or demerit of the proposal of my friend the Member for Sunderland a to submit an Amendment which even assume the ground take by my friend to be sound I believe will remove the ambiguity involve in his Motion All the law affect Trades Unions have their foundation in a preliminary inquiry That be the case with the Royal Commission preside over by the Lord Chief Justice and which sit from to and with the subsequent Royal Commission of If we be to have any legislation affect the Trades Unions of this country then I submit that before such legislation be propose we ought to have some inquiry to enlighten u a to what be the actual condition of the law It be admit that there be uncertainty in regard to that which should be remove If the Motion of the Member for Sunderland be pass in the form in which it now stand it might merely mean that the inquiry should be make by a Committee of this House because my friend simply say a Committee I be quite sure that the and learn Gentleman who second the Motion be the last person in the world to recommend a Select Committee of this House It be not for me to argue what would probably happen if there be such a Select Committee The Gentleman refer to the bias which some people might have who have read for instance Sydney Webb book but whatever view we take on this question we all admit that a Select Committee be not either a proper or a good tribunal to deal with this subject Therefore that ambiguity should be remove from my friend Motion Whether it would be good to appoint a Departmental Committee of expert or a Royal Commission be a matter worthy of consideration and for debate I think a Depart mental Committee be very often apt to judge from the experience of various such Committees to labour the official view of the Department I do not say that the employer view of labour question be necessarily hostile to that of the workman I believe it be not the case in case out of a hundred and that the two interest be so combined and conjoin that it be impossible except with a malicious intent to divide the one from the other If that be so I submit that a Departmental Committee would be by no mean a good tribunal to deal with this question So far a I know the only other method leave be a Royal Commission I know it be suggest sometimes that Royal Commissions be often appoint for the purpose of delay legislation but if there be any guilt in the matter it be share equally by both side of the House I be sure that my friend will agree that this House should thoroughly understand a question before it attempt to legislate upon it My friend hold decided view on various question and he would not suggest that the House should embark on legislation on a subject which he himself do not understand It be admit then that we do not know exactly where the law stand and there be no other method which I can imagine of afford u the information we require than by an inquiry by a Royal Commission Therefore I beg to move the omission of the word Committee in the Motion of my friend and the insertion of the word Commission I use the word Commission advisedly because I do not know whether technically I would be carry the Government with me if this suggestion of mine be agree to I do not think it be necessary that there should be a limit to the number of Members on the Commission but at the same time I do not think it necessary it should be a large Commission On the contrary it would be very much good if all contending interest be exclude from this body and that there should be include only those competent to form a from a legal and a point of view I know it may be urge that we can not appeal to the judge for any assistance in this inquiry because they would not be able to spare the time for this additional work although I can not imagine any work in which the judge could be more properly engage than in settle a difficulty of this kind Whether the Commission should be large or small it be not for me to say but I wish to remove any ambiguity in the original Motion and to make it quite clear that the inquiry should be make not by a Committee but by a Commission HOPE Sheffield I have an Amendment on the Paper to the Motion of my friend the Member for Sunderland but I be bound to say that in put down that Amendment I base it on the view to which the and learn Member for have give expression I have have the hope of gratify the ambition of hatch the egg which the and learned Member have lay but I feel that now he have cut the ground from under my foot I will confine myself to one or two general observation In the first place there be a point on which I think we all agree It be certain that the law a it stand at present be obscure and that it be suspect that the law at present be partial The obscurity ought to be make clear and the absolute fairness and equality of the law ought to be demonstrate without doubt or cavil Whatever view we may take of labour dispute I think all party who have to enter such dispute have a right to know where they stand and have a right to meet each other on equal term I do not believe that Parliament will ever give any privilege to one class and deny it to another Ironical cheer from the OPPOSITION Benches Certainly Parliament ought not to do so and it ought to be absolutely clear that if unfortunate labour dispute do take place both side should meet to settle their difference in a fair field and with no favour As to the composition of whatever body be appoint to investigate this matter I believe there be a distinct prejudice against a Royal Commission constitute in the ordinary way It be find that when a large Commission be appoint represent every kind of interest and when that Commission sit over a long period hearing every kind of evidence from every quarter an impression be produce on the public mind that it have be appoint to shelve the matter I deprecate that that should be the ease on this occasion I think that whatever body be appoint to inquire into this question should be small expert and impartial An MEMBER on the Opposition Benches Why not appoint the House of Lords The appointment of the Commission ought to be make on the assumption that real be mean and that the state of the law should be so settled that no Party will be able to say that they be aggrieve or that all be not place on a footing of equality BELL I think this must be an evening of short speech These must necessarily he compress in consequence of the narrow line on which we shall have to confine ourselves in discuss the matter before the House I certainly feel gratify with the Member for Sunderland for the sympathetic manner in which he introduce his Motion but all I hear fall from his lip seem to be argument why his Motion should nor be carry They be argument for the Bill set down for Second Beading on May and everything cover therein I have hear remark in favour of a Committee a Commission or something else to inquire into the state of the law and at the same time each of the speaker have admit that the law be in an unsatisfactory state That be the reason why Bills have be introduce into the House for the specific purpose of put the law on a satisfactory footing but if this Motion be adopt it will prejudice the chance of any of these Bills be carry for it will be say that a Royal Commission or a Select Committee be inquire into the subject matter of the Bill and until it have report the of the House must be withhold and Members will not be incline to give the Bill their support It be all very well for Gentlemen to offer u their sympathy and I be oblige to them for it But last year we have a Motion before the House in which we want the appointment of a Committee on practically the same line a that propose by the Member for Sunderland that the Government should do something to codify the law so that employer and workman lawyer and judge might know how to deal with these matter On that occasion Members refuse to support it Perhaps I be not right or fair in suggest that if we be not in a favourable position for bring our Bill before the House we should not have have a Motion of this description at all SO far a I be concerned that be not my intention and a a matter of fact I support the Motion last year BELL I fully accept the and learn Member explanation and I be much oblige to him for the support he give u on that occasion For once perhaps I be in agreement with the employer I receive a circular from them ask me along with others to oppose this Motion GALLOWAY I be in no way interested in the circular BELL I do not suggest that the Member be interested in it I simply refer to the fact that such a circular have be send to me The argument adduce by the Member for Manchester be really argument against the Motion and in favour of the Bill I know the Member tor Manchester hold very different view about Trades Unions from what I do and that be perhaps really the reason why he want a Commission or the House of Lords to inquire into this matter However the action of Members in the House in refuse u support when we ask last year for a Committee of Inquiry into the state of the law in order that it might be codify have raise a storm in the country which have have the effect of induce Members opposite to support this Motion and to show that they be in favour of something be do The Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress which represent of the worker of this country have make up it mind on this subject and we be go to test the opinion and sympathy of this House by bring forward our Bill on May I ask the House and especially those who sympathise or even say that they sympathise with the Trade Unions to vote against both the Motion and the Amendment and to be in their place on May to give their support to the Bill LAWSON WALTON Leeds I would like to say a word on this Motion associate myself for the moment with my friend behind me and at the same time associate myself with the Member for Sunderland I do not think that the view of these Gentlemen be necessarily inconsistent Personally I share profoundly the opinion express on all side of the House that the exist state of the law be extremely unsatisfactory I also share the feeling of my friend behind me that it ought to be amend at the early possible date But I be not so sanguine a he seem to be that the of May will see an alteration make in the Statute Law In all probability the extremely slow operation of the legislative machinery of this House will involve the elapse of a considerable time before the necessary change be introduce But in the meantime it be surely of the utmost importance that we should ascertain definitely what the state of the law be before proceed to legislative action I defy any lawyer to expound the law at present in clear term Before we can amend it or before we can consider the rational application of the propose change we should know the specific to which these change be intend to apply I trust that within the limit of the very narrow groove which you Speaker have announce in reference to this Motion I shall be able to indicate what should be the subject which this House should refer to a Committee or Commission SPEAKER Order order The and learned Member have be really for the last five minute argue the question of the Bill I hope he will not pursue that course LAWSON WALTON Of course I accept your view Speaker but it be difficult to justify a reference to a Committee without in some measure trench on the of the Bill I might be in order if it be the fact that the state of the law we propose to change be uncertain in argue that there should be some preparatory inquiry to ascertain what exactly the law be SPEAKER The Gentleman be repeat the same thing although I quite appreciate the difficulty he be in LAWSON WALTON say he support this Motion in the hope that the legislation propose might be final and that the result would not be a further conflict between the construction of the Statute and the view of the judge and he trust that there would not be further confusion between Statute Law and law He think all this might be avoid by some form of preliminary inquiry Leicester say that all those who be specially interested in Trades Union legislation could not view with favour the Motion make by the Member for Sunderland What the Labour Party contend for be that their difficulty be well know and their danger well define and that they have a remedy sufficient for the purpose in the form of a Bill which would shortly be introduce Therefore an inquiry rightly or wrongly could only be use a an excuse to evade a direct issue on the of May of what be require Holding those view it be impossible to agree in any measure whatever with any view or policy that would lead to delay of even an hour on this great question The Tory Government in find itself in a similar position In the year he himself be in a responsible position and he remember that the Government be sorely press and indeed oppress with the operation of the Law of Conspiracy and the Law of Contract In the General Election which take place in February they heckle every candidate in the country on the issue which come out at that General Election The overwhelming majority of member return in February be steep in pledge in favour of the view of the Labour Party at that time When the Government be form in the year by Disraeli a similar Motion to the one now make by the Member for Sunderland lead to the appointment of a Commission against the clear declaration of all party that the House should proceed to legislation Their case now be that there be no necessity in their for this inquiry because the fact be before all party and any willing wishing to relieve both side of this dilemma could do so at very short notice The Commission he have refer to be appoint and the Member for Morpeth be invite to join the Commission but he refuse A number of the lead Labour leader refuse to give evidence before that Commission and the Government be force to bring the inquiry to a close After that a within a few week draw a Bill both with regard to conspiracy and the law of contract which if not entirely satisfy all the demand of the Labour Party be so well ground that it satisfy the want of the Labour world for a great number of year If the House now agree to the appointment of this Committee it would be take purely a an evasion and a a mean of avoid the expression of the opinion of the House on a direct issue and all such policy be undesirable It be on those ground that they view with disfavour this proposal because they think it would be take a a way of escape from say directly aye or no to a straight question which would be put to Parliament on the of May Therefore they be bind to oppose this Motion and all of Trades Unions and all who desire that peace should reign between Capital and Labour in this country ought to oppose this Motion He hold strong opinion upon this subject and he sincerely hop that both side would join in reject this suggestion for an unlimited delay in legislation because legislation upon this question be a most urgent need in order to protect the interest of hundred and thousand of the worker of this country STUART Sheffield say that nobody be ask for delay in regard to this question and he do not think legislation of this sort would be hasten by speech make in such a spirit a that which have just be deliver by the Member for Leicester OPPOSITION cry of Oh oh The time have go by when either the House of Commons or the public outside could be drive into any such course by the use of minatory and language He have a strong preference for the appointment of a Royal Commission rather than a Select Committee There be a much more difficult question before the legislature in the year when a Royal Commission be appoint At that time Parliament appoint a strictly impartial Committee and they recommend legislation which be strong enough to last for a generation There be another precedent in when the right Gentleman the Member for East Fife appoint a Commission to deal with certain riot arise out of a coal strike in that year If in the present case they get from a Commission appoint a report so luminous and valuable a be produce on that occasion it would be a great advantage and he do not think any more delay than be absolutely necessary need be fear He hop if there be to be an inquiry it would be by a Royal Commission and that it would not be constitute by the discredited method of give representation to those contend party from whom it be impossible to get an impartial SHACKLETON Lancashire say he be sorry the Member for Sheffield have introduce word which be calculate to give offence to Members He do not think anything have be say to justify the remark which the Member for Sheffield have make and as far a he be personally concerned he should endeavour to keep from remark which would give offence to anybody What they desire be that the opinion of the House should be give on this question The employer be perfectly satisfy in their own opinion a to what the law be but the so far a the decision which have be give from time to time be not satisfy and they be anxious to get away altogether from the legal decision which have be give within the past few year They wish to lay clearly before the country the position which they desire to be in SPEAKER Order order If I allow the Gentleman to proceed on these line I shall be invite a discussion which I have rule to be out of order SHACKLETON say he would bow to Speaker ruling and what he be go to say be that they do not feel that the Committee of this House chosen a suggest from those not interested in the case either on one side or the other would be of any advantage at all They be also of opinion that the appointment of a Royal Commission mean delay certainly of month and might be year and he appeal to the House for the sake of peace in the country and in order to be able to conduct any future dispute in a proper manner that this matter should be settle by Parliament as soon a possible He think the House would be wise in accept the advice of the employer on the one side and of the representative of Labour on the other side The employer distinctly advise that this question should be settle not that night but on the of May and the Coal Miners Association advise the same thing and these two association represent per cent of the employer of this country He appeal to the Government not to give any encouragement to this Motion because he felt sure the people would take it a an attempt to delay legislation and nothing else He hop the House would defeat the Motion WHITE say he sincerely hop the Government would see their way to grant a small Commission He think they might take it that it be the general sense of the House and of the country that the law upon this question be in a state of chaos but they be not all agree that the bringing of a Bill before the House be the best way to remedy this state of chaos It be possible that a small Commission would be able to put the state of the law into some coherent code and that would probably be the best way of settle the question which they all admit be of a very complicated character The Homo Secretary have state that the Government would not shrink from make an inquiry if they think it be necessary and therefore he think they might take it that the Government be not entirely averse to the principle of an inquiry In order that they might arrive at a fair and come to a decision he think that some such inquiry a that propose by his friend the Member for Sunderland be absolutely necessary Without any disrespect to the Gentlemen who have take part in this debate I venture to record my own opinion which be that I have rarely hear a more unprofitable discussion unprofitable not from any fault on the part of those Members who have share in it and not from any lack of interest on the part of the House upon a subject which if we have be able to approach it would have engross universal attention but unprofitable owing to the condition under which the debate be carry out which preclude u from discuss even the subject matter We can not approach even the outskirt of the subject our tongue be tie and our hand be fetter and we be really beat the air to no purpose An MEMBER Ploughing the sand I agree with the suggestion that at the early possible moment this discussion should come to an end It appear to me that neither the representative of the employer nor of the employ be anxious for the passing of the Motion which have be suggest For my own part I agree with my Iron and learn friend behind me that there be at any rate a considerable area of the exist law which be cover by recent decision with obscurity and confusion and a I have say before I do not believe that any lawyer who have study the decision of the Courts could advise with any confidence in any give state of circumstance what Acts be legal and what be illegal and what constitute a conspiracy and what do not But there be certain defect of the law which be patent and obvious and capable of a clear remedy which have be reveal by recent decision There be the law of picket for instance and some branch of the law of agency THE SPEAKER I must remind the right Iron Gentleman that the point enumerate by him be specifically dealt with in the Bills which have be introduce ASQUITH I have unconsciously illustrate my own contention that it be impossible to discuss this subject with any profit under exist condition because the moment you approach a concrete fact you be pull up and you can not get on I would strongly deprecate any Commission or Committee of inquiry a likely to be rely on a an argument against immediate legislation and since it be clear that neither of the interest concern desire the inquiry I appeal to the mover to withdraw his Motion THE SOLICITOR GENERAL Sir EDWARD CARSON Dublin University I only rise to what be say by the right Iron Gentleman opposite and I agree with him that whatever importance there may be attach to this Motion if we be free to discuss it and I be far from say that if we be free there might not be a great deal to be say in favour of the course which be suggest I still do think that on the matter introduce by my friend the mover which be one of extreme importance we do find ourselves almost in a ludicrous position in try to come to any conclusion What be the position in which we be place The Motion suggest that we should ask for a Committee or a Commission to examine into the exist law a it affect Trades Unions Sir your ruling prevents u from even talk about what that law be The Motion go far and ask that the inquiry should also be an inquiry a to what the alteration of the law should be But we be not allow to refer to such alteration and therefore we be really during the whole of this debate talk in the abstract and we be unable to illustrate a single argument by a concrete example and we be in such a position that I hardly think the House with the exception of those Gentlemen who have go minutely into these decision and happen to know them be in a position to discuss this question at all Sir in addition to that we have Members get up and say that they do not want this Motion and therefore I do not really see what use it be to proceed with the discussion I therefore join with the right Gentleman in ask the Member to withdraw his Motion With the leave of the House I should like to withdraw my Motion GALLOWAY And I also ask leave to withdraw my Amendment"

right of the king to dispose of the personal chattel of the crown without an act of parliament The Lord Chancellor in reply to the question of the noble lord say there be two thing to be consider first the capacity of the donor to give and secondly the capacity of the to take If it have be a question a to give the library to a corporation such a the Museum he should have say that with respect to the personal chattel of the crown his majesty might dispose of them if the party to whom they be dispose be capable of take but when the question be put whether the nation could take and in what manner it be to take he have think it right to give some consideration before he reply With respect to the question generally his decided opinion be that his majesty have the power of give away the personal chattel of the crown in his and he should say before the and of the late king it be at least doubtful whether he could not dispose of them by will His majesty could originally a the and of contained nothing but enact clause dispose by will of the personal chattel of the crown and if the chattel be of the description specify in the act it must be take a the good opinion that they could not be dispose of by will Before the restrain act of parliament the power of alienation be suppose to be incidental to be seize in fee and land be constantly dispose of by the crown The land of the monastery and abbey at the time of their suppression be grant to great family in so liberal a manner a to secure the gratitude of their posterity a have be often see and his majesty might lawfully do it He use the word lawful a a lawyer not a a statesman and in that sense he would say that the crown might do lawfully in the premise what it be not restrain from do by act of parliament One al the argument use by lord Coke apply to the present case He say that suppose a person to be possess of large estate before coin to the crown if the attach to those estate he would be place in a bad situation than any other person notwithstanding the accession to the crown cure all other defect and he be of opinion the crown have the right of dispose of such estate Whether he give a right opinion a a statesman he the lord chancellor world not say Statesmen think lawyer have statesman and lawyer certainly think themselves good statesman He would say when ask his opinion a a lawyer that if the law confer the power now contemplate by the bill to be vest in the crown he have no right to contemplate the abuse of such a power If the noble lord want authority in support of the legal principle recognize in the bill he would find them in and and other writer of equal antiquity Lord regret that the learned lord answer be not so satisfactory a he could have wish Although entirely incompetent to enter into a legal argument with the learned lord he must still entertain considerable doubt a to the power of the crown to dispose of personal chattel in the same manner a a private individual could and when a question arose upon such a point he think it be their duty to prevent the possibility of abuse with respect to the chattel of the king In early time the property of the crown be govern upon principle quite distinct from those which regulate the distribution of private effect From the time of Alfred down through successive reign it be hold that crown property be inalienable that it belong to the kingdom not to the king Lord Coke have hold that the king could not dispose of the crown jewel and that they be an to the throne He know that the common law have make great inroad upon the but still he entertain great doubt from the current of authority that the crown have not the power to dispose of personal chattel Taking then the present bill in conjunction with the other contemplated legislative proceeding respect the transfer of the late king library to the British Museum he could not avoid view both with great suspicion and a indicate the introduction of a principle the object of which be to separate the personal property of the sovereign before his accession to the crown from that subsequently acquire and to create a new power of distribution not recognize by the previous law There might be some motive for a new arrangement be there child for whom a separate provision might be necessary but here there be no such plea and why not allow the crown property generally to devolve upon the successor to the throne The king have for the last eight year be apply the crown property to improve certain personal property which he be now accord to this bill to have the power of sell It be a matter of record that in the year be give from the of the Admiralty to the present king to buy furniture for his residence at Brighton and now a new light a it be break in upon minister and they saw the necessity of introduce a bill to create a distinction between the personal chattel of the sovereign and crown property He have a general objection on principle to invest the crown with personal right of property it would be accumulate upon the king two incompatible right not only inconsistent but inconvenient in their exercise The Earl of Liverpool say he felt it a duty which he owe the sovereign as well a his majesty government to do away the impression convey by the speech of the noble lord a if some trick be intend to be practise by this bill and a if it be to be upon another bill connect with a most liberal gift from his majesty to the public He would call upon the learned lord on the and his other noble friend who be minister of the crown to say whether the present bill be not quite distinct from the transaction of the munificent gift allude to and whether it have not be under consideration three year ago and long before that gift have be think of He must lament that an act which have excite throughout the country almost one universal feeling of gratitude a transaction which reflect a much honour upon the memory of the late king who in the long period of year have acquire one of the most valuable collection of learn which ever exist in one library a it do upon his present majesty who have evince a willingness to devote such a collection to the public service in the way which appear to parliament most eligible for the general advantage should have be so misconstrue His majesty have make no stipulation that it should be give to this or to that place but have leave it to the discretion of parliament to dispose of it in the manner most beneficial to the country It be too much that an act in itself so gracious and conduct in so constitutional a manner should be describe a something like a trick to promote some particular object He would not now enter into the justice or injustice of the act of the and of the late king but he would say that upon the general principle of justice and the analogy of law nothing would be more unfair than to deprive the king of power over his private property acquire out of his revenue when prince of Wales and which at such time he could without any possibility of cavil have dispose of a he think proper now that he have succeed to the crown or to place his majesty in such a situation a to be the only person in the kingdom whose recognize right be to be take from him upon his accession to a high dignity The Lord Chancellor declare in the most solemn and unequivocal manner that there be no connexion between the present bill and that contemplate elsewhere respect the late king library The transaction be wholly distinct Lord contend that until the act of queen Anne the power of the crown to grant laud have be unlimited It be true that when those grant be not approve of the minister by whose advice they have be make have be impeach but even then the grant have not be revoke Why have the act of queen Anne be pass if the crown have not previously possess the right of grant land But the fact be that half the land in the kingdom be by grant from the crown"
59329	"LORDS' AMENDMENTS. [ADJOURNED DEBATE.]_1887"	"DILLON Mayo I regret very much that I be compel by the circumstance of the case to ask the House to adjourn for another week the consideration of this Bill Oh Perhaps Gentlemen before they express their disapprobation will listen to my explanation It will be in the recollection of the House that this Bill have for a long period be postpone from time to time for one object and for one object only namely to secure the passing of another Bill which relate to the subject in order to provide that something should be do to secure for the ratepayer of Belfast the full control over the expenditure of the money which be involve in the passing of this Bill At this very moment I understand that the House of Lords be engage in the Report and Amendments of the Security Bill and we be absolutely in the dark a to what shape that Bill will ultimately take That have be the sole object with which these repeat adjournment have be assent to by the House and that object have not yet be achieve I can not conceive anything more absurd than that this House have consent to repeat postponement for a certain object should now allow this Bill to be pass before that object have be attain No doubt it will be urge by the promoter of the Bill that they have be subject to great inconvenience by those repeated adjournment but in reply to that argument I say that they have to thank another place where the progress of Public Business be extremely slow That be not our fault If the Irish Members have any control over the matter the Security Bill would have be pass long ago in order that the question it involve might receive full discussion here I feel bound under the circumstance of the case to move that the further consideration of the Lords Amendments be adjourn until this day week SPEAKER May I suggest to the Member that the proper course be to move the adjournment of the debate DILLON Then I beg to do so SIR JAMES Armagh Mid It be absolutely impossible that we can consent to this Motion We have repeatedly consent to adjournment and on the last occasion when the Bill be before the House the debate be adjourn at the suggestion of the Chairman of Ways and Means until on the distinct understanding that the Lords Amendments should be then consider I think it be very unfair to ask for a further postponement The Member for East Mayo Dillon have refer to a Bill which be in another place but my Friend the Member for North Belfast have give Notice of a clause which he propose to add to the Main Drainage Bill which will give to the ratepayer of Belfast the most complete control over the drainage work and the expenditure which they will involve This clause have be very carefully draft and I know that it meet with the approval of the Chairman of Ways and Means I believe that it will give to the ratepayer of Belfast even more complete control over the expenditure of money than the clause which have be insert in the Franchise Bill in another place It be not possible for me to discuss the Franchise Bill at the present moment but I feel bound to resist the Motion for Adjournment SEXTON Belfast The Baronet have inform the House that it be not possible for him to consent to the further adjournment ask for by my Friend the Member for East Mayo I think I shall be able to show in a very few word that it be utterly impossible for the House to proceed with this measure at the present moment The Baronet refer to an understanding which be come to in my absence on Monday last I very much regret that in consequence of certain important business in Ireland I be prevent from be present on that occasion My Friend the Member for Mid Tyrone Kenny say on that occasion that he believe there would he a prospect to the Lords Amendments be consider but he be then under the impression that what my Friend the Member for East Mayo have rightly call the Security Bill would be in our hand Unfortunately that be not the case The Security Bill be still in the House of Lords and that House be engage at the present moment consider the Report of the Amendments upon it We have now a demand make upon u which I can only characterize a unprecedented to allow this Bill to go out of our hand without have the Franchise Bill before u and without be able to arrive at any notion of the form which the security be to take No doubt there have be repeat postponement but why have the Bill be postpone It have be postpone in order to obtain an object which have not yet be achieve This House have pass a Bill to extend the municipal franchise in Belfast and this House have declare not only that the franchise shall be extend but that the extended franchise shall be apply to the Register of the present year in other word that the present Town Council be to go out of office this year and until the new Council be elect no step shall be take to fix upon the borough of Belfast the liability involve in carry out this scheme a liability of the expenditure of impose upon a town which be already burden with a debt of Then how can we proceed with the Lords Amendments to this Bill The very first Amendment of importance be a new provision which have be insert in the Bill by the House of Lords The Lords have strike out the clause insert here which extend the municipal franchise in Belfast It be in view of the Amendment that this House pass the Municipal Franchise Bill The Lords have allow an extension of the franchise but they have strike out the provision which apply the new franchise to the Register of the present year and they have strike out a further provision which forbid the Town Council of Belfast from proceed with their scheme until the new Council shall have be elect Noble Lords act on behalf of the Town Council of Belfast have strike out every vestige of security without be in possession of any absolute knowledge of the merit of the question I understand that it be intend to move the restoration of those clause and we may know the result in the course of an hour or two At present however we do not know the result and yet we be nevertheless ask to give up the last security we have in regard to the question I will ask you Sir how in such a case I be to proceed How be I to decide whether or not I ought to ask the House to disagree with the Lords Amendments which have so materially alter the character of the Franchise Clause When the Bill come down from the House of Lords we shall know the final shape the Amendments have assume If I know now that the new Town Council will be elect upon the extended franchise this year I could make up my mind but until we be able to make up our mind on that point it be impossible to say what course we ought to take No doubt before this day week we shall know what have be do by the House of Lords and whether we ought to accept these Amendments or not If the House refuse the reasonable request of my Friend the Member for East Mayo I shall have no alternative but to move that the House disagree with the Amendments of the Lords and to begin with it will be necessary to discuss at length the most important one namely that which relate to the extension of the municipal franchise I will only ask the House if it be necessary or desirable that a long debate should take place upon that point which subsequent event may render altogether unnecessary Under the circumstance Speaker I will ask you for a moment to give your kind attention to the question especially in reference to the clause which the Member for North Belfast propose to introduce As the House be aware we be now in the stage of consider the Lords Amendments and I ask you Sir if it will be in Order to discuss any Amendment which do not deal strictly with the Amendments which have be introduce by the House of Lords I take it that the only Constitutional right which this House now possess be to consider the Amendments which the House of Lords have make in the Bill The Member for North Belfast propose to introduce an Amendment which do not deal with any matter that have be touch upon by the Lords Amendments The Bill propose that the franchise shall be exercise in a certain manner but the Member propose that it shall be deal with in another manner There be nothing in this Bill which deal with Schedule of the Public Health Act and I would submit to you Sir that it be not competent for the House to consider or for the Member to move any clause of this kind The protection which the clause offer to the ratepayer of Belfast be altogether illusory I regard it a a breach of faith and a one of the Representatives of the people of Belfast who be the person most concern in the Bill I protest against it and shall resist it to the utmost in the first place because it be out of Order and secondly because it stultify the action of the people of Belfast The House have pass a clause declare that the power of the Bill shall be exercise after a public election of the Town Council under a certain franchise and the Member who propose this clause be clearly ask the House to stultify itself in decide the question before it can possibly know what course have be take in another place in reference to the Franchise Bill I be astonish that the Gentleman should have the audacity to come here while the matter be in suspense to ask u to traverse and overcome the settlement which have already be arrive at by admit an absurd and fantastic clause which it be altogether out of Order to introduce into a Private Bill Under these circumstance I maintain that it be impossible to proceed with the Bill and I ask you Sir if it be in Order for the Gentleman to propose the clause he have place upon the Paper and to represent it a a proper question to discuss on the consideration of Amendments of the House of Lords which have no reference whatever to the subject SPEAKER In reference to the point of Order I will read Clause which have be insert in the Bill by the House of Lords in substitution of Clause The Corporation shall within seven year from the passing of this Act make and complete such low level sewer and work a may be necessary for intercept and divert into the outfall work by this Act authorize all the sewage flow into the River and the Victoria Channel through the sewer of the Corporation which shall not be intercept by the high level sewer by this Act authorize and the Corporation shall commence such low level sewer and work as soon a the other work by this Act authorize shall he so far advanced that they can conveniently do so The new clause propose by the Gentleman the Member for North Belfast propose to restrict the action to be take or the expenditure to be incur under the Act until the execution of the work have receive the consent of the owner and ratepayer of the borough I can not say that such a proposal be out of Order It appear to be consequential upon the new clause introduce by the House of Lords to restrict the liability which may be incur under the Act and it be certainly not irrelevant to that clause SEXTON May I Sir respectfully explain that a the Main Drainage Bill stand in the House of Commons it be optional with the Corporation of Belfast to proceed with the second part of the Bill It be compulsory upon them to proceed with the first part but the Committee of the House of Lords make a material change in the measure by insert a clause which oblige the Corporation of Belfast to proceed with certain work within a limited number of year after the passing of the Act That be the point which I raise a a question of Order SPEAKER I do not think I can rule in any other way than that in which I have already rule As I have say before I do not think it be out of Order or that it would be improper to restrict the action of the Corporation in reference to the incurring of any liability in respect of the drainage work until the execution of the work itself have receive the sanction of the owner and ratepayer of the borough THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES COURTNEY Cornwall On the point of Order Sir I think your ruling be conclusive With regard to the question of adjournment I would remind the House that this Bill be exactly in the same position on Monday a it be now The plea then raise for an adjournment be solely that it be undesirable to consider the Bill in the absence of the Member for West Belfast Sexton No There be no other ground assign I beg the Gentleman pardon who say No I be present myself on the occasion and I know that that be the only objection which be raise to proceed with the Bill Indeed it be say that if the Gentleman have be present no objection would have be raise to go on with the consideration of the Lords Amendments and it be solely in consequence of the absence of the Member that the debate be adjourn until upon the distinct understanding that however unavoidable his absence might be whether he be here or not the Bill would go on The matter have be decide in that way I confess I think that the House would scarcely be act consistently with what be do last Monday if it be to consent now to a further adjournment NORRIS Tower Hamlets The Question before the House be whether the debate should be again adjourned and I wish to say a few word in order to explain the reason which induce me to support the Motion of the Member for East Mayo I entirely concur in every word that have be state by the Member for West Belfast Sexton I think we be not only justified but bound to hang up a final decision upon the Drainage Bill until we be in a position to know whether in the interest of local there be to be a satisfactory extension of the municipal franchise in the borough of Belfast or not A great deal have be say about local and what do local mean in this case but the extension of the municipal franchise Therefore I think it be perfectly consistent with the principle I hold and our advocacy of this Bill that in the absence of the measure now in the House of Lords for the extension of the municipal franchise further time should be give for the consideration of the Lords Amendments in the Drainage Bill The Member for West Belfast have point out that the Lords Bill be not now before u and therefore we be unable to consider the principle upon which the extension of the municipal franchise in Ireland be to be carry out and whether the local which we be continually advocate for this country be to be extend to Ireland or not I therefore hope that Members on this side of the House will join with me in support the Motion for the adjournment of this debate I would remind Members that on a former occasion when a local question connect with West London be before the House many Members give way in deference to the opinion and feeling of the people who be principally interested I regard the present circumstance a of a similar character and with these few word I beg to say that I on my part shall support the Motion of the Member for East Mayo JOHNSTON Belfast I hope Sir that the House will refuse to listen to any proposition for the further postponement of this important question As one of those Members whose constituent be deeply interested in the passing of the Bill I be almost ashamed of the number of time Members have be require to come down to support the measure with the only result of find the Bill postpone from time to time in order to meet the convenience of Gentlemen opposite If any pledge be ever give in this House that be of a positive character it be the pledge give on day last by the Member for Mid Tyrone Kenny on behalf of the Member for West Belfast that the Lords Amendments should be take into consideration The ratepayer of Belfast will be afford a full opportunity of consider the measure and of control the execution of the work a will be evident to every man who will read the new clause which be propose to be insert by my Friend the Member for North Belfast I know that it would be out of Order to discuss that clause now and therefore I will not attempt to do so but Gentlemen who have urge so strongly that the ratepayer should be give full control over the expenditure before the work be carry into execution must be aware that the delay in proceed with the Municipal Franchise Bill in another place be not attributable to any action on the part of my Friend the Member for North Belfast or of the promoter of the Drainage Bill but on the contrary that the postponement of that measure until be resolve upon at the instance of a noble Lord who support the view of the Member for West Belfast I think that we who be deeply interested in the matter on behalf of the citizen of Belfast should be no longer trifle with but that the House should proceed at once to take the Lords Amendments into consideration KENNY Tyrone Mid As I move the Amendment on Monday I desire to say one or two word When the House adjourn the debate upon the Bill on Monday last it be not solely on the ground of the absence of my Friend the Member for West Belfast but equally on the ground that we expect on this day that the House would be in possession of the Bill which be now under consideration in another place and which be down for consideration on Monday last but which instead of be consider and dispose of on Tuesday a we have every reason then to believe and expect have be adjourn for consideration until this day The result be that both Bills have be set down for consideration on the same day one in the other House and one in this House Now I think it be absolutely impossible for this House to proceed with the consideration of the present Bill with any degree of satisfaction until it be in possession of the final shape which the Municipal Franchise Bill be to take in another place It be on these ground that I move the adjournment of the debate on Monday and since then the second of those ground have become of considerable importance DE Belfast As one of the Members for Belfast I wish to state the feeling which I entertain upon this matter I be perfectly ready to say that as far a I can understand the conclusion which the House arrive at in regard to this question on a previous occasion it be that in the mind of the House it be our duty to give the people of Belfast popular control over the public expenditure It appear to me that the action take by the House of Lords in reference to the Franchise Bill which would enable the class of Belfast to give full expression to their opinion in regard to the merit of this measure have practically rescind the decision arrive at in this House If there be any undertaking in regard to the course to be take in reference to the Main Drainage Bill it be accompany by an undertaking on behalf of the promoter of the measure that the Franchise Bill which be now in the House of Lords should be before this House before any final decision be arrive at There be a clear understanding that if the Franchise Bill be pass in an unobjectionable form we in this House be quite ready to allow the Main Drainage Bill to pass But the promoter of the Main Drainage Bill in the House of Lords who be the friend of the Corporation of Belfast have endeavour to defer the operation of the Franchise Bill until November and our view be that if the Franchise Bill can not be bring into immediate operation and the whole of the class can not have the power of deal with the question on the of next November all the objection we have express to the passing of the Drainage Bill in the absence of a complete control over the execution of the work by the inhabitant will be defeat If on the contrary it be provide that the opinion of the ratepayer shall be clearly express on the of November next all our objection to the immediate passing of the present measure will be remove and I should then be dispose strongly to advise the House to pass the Bill I receive a copy of a resolution pass I unanimously by the Corporation of Belfast in which they ask the Members for the borough of Belfast to support the immediate passing of the Franchise Act which be to extend the municipal register of that borough After pass this resolution to meet the eye of the people of Belfast the representative of the Corporation go to the House of Lords to get that House to delay the operation of the Franchise Act so that the Main Drainage Bill might have a start of it by nearly a year and a half I consider that to be a most perfidious breach of faith with the work class of Belfast but perfectly in harmony with the course the promoter of both measure have pursue from the first I think the House ought to he able to trust the people of Belfast and I respectfully submit that the inhabitant of that borough have quite a strong a claim upon the consideration of both Houses of Parliament a the Corporation a privileged class who be the promoter of this main drainage scheme If a guarantee be give by the promoter of the Bill that the expenditure involve in carry out the drainage scheme will be place immediately under the control of the ratepayer then I be prepared to consent to the passing of the present Bill but if no such guarantee be give I trust the House will agree to the Motion for adjourn the debate RUSSELL Tyrone Having vote in favour of the previous adjournment of the consideration of this Bill I desire now to express a hope that the House will not consent to a further adjournment and I will state in a few word why I take that ground A great many Members consent to the adjournment of the Bill on account of the state of the borough franchise in Belfast A measure to remedy that state of the franchise have pass through this House and be now before the other House of Parliament It be quite true that in another place Amendments have be make of which I and others do not approve but those Amendments will have to come back here for the sanction of this House before they can become law and the promoter of the Bill have do everything in their power to meet the wish and aim of the Member for West Belfast Indeed they have consent to insert in the Bill a clause which will enable and entitle every ratepayer in Belfast to vote Aye or No whether one farthing shall be expend in carry out the provision of the Franchise Bill or not Under these circumstance I earnestly hope that the House will not consent to postpone the Bill one day longer The measure be earnestly need in Belfast and it ought to be allow to pass at once Belfast I will not detain the House for more than a moment I only wish to say that the Member for West Belfast Sexton have entirely fail to meet the argument which have be bring forward in favour of go on with the Bill On the last occasion when the Bill be under discussion I point to the fact that it be impossible to get the new Burgess Roll ready in time for the next election in November and that the risk would be run of bring the town affair of Belfast to a deadlock I pass over the abusive observation of the Member for West Belfast but in reply to the remark of the Member for East Mayo Dillon I wish to say that the promoter of the Bill be not responsible for the delay which have occur in the House of Lords Some allusion have be make to a noble Lord have be employ by the Town Council of Belfast to take charge of the matter in the House of Lords but I think I might retort on Members opposite and say that the noble Lord who have be employ by the opponent to take charge of their interest be the very person who move the adjournment of the consideration of the Franchise Bill from Monday last until Consequently the promoter of the Bill be in no way responsible for the delay which have occur If the House of Lords make any Amendments in the Franchise Bill which be not palatable to this House the House will have an opportunity of deal with them when the Bill come down here I believe that the clause which I propose will meet all the objection of the Member behind me De It place the entire power in the hand of the constituency who will be able to say when and how the Bill be to be bring into operation THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES COURTNEY Cornwall On the question of the consideration of the Lords Amendments it may perhaps save a little time if I be allow to make a short statement The House will remember that when this Bill be originally before u clause be insert in it deal with the municipal franchise of Belfast a matter which at the time I think be foreign to the of the Bill and I oppose their insertion Nevertheless the House agree to those clause and the Bill go up to the House of Lords where they be strike out Substantially therefore a great change be make in the Bill and the matter come back to this House for reconsideration It be then argue with great force and I think with great that it be improper that the important work which be to be undertake under the provision of the Bill should be conduct under the auspex of a Town Council elect by a very restricted franchise It be suggest in order to avoid what be conceive to be the impropriety of entrust the execution of the work to a Corporate Body elect upon the basis of a narrow franchise that another Bill should be bring in deal with the municipal franchise in Ireland and that the exist municipal franchise should be reduce throughout the whole of the borough of Ireland On the understanding that a Bill of that character should be promote as rapidly a possible the consideration of the Lords Amendments to the present Bill be suspend and this House ultimately arrive at condition under which the main drainage scheme might be set go with a proper control of the expenditure on the part of the ratepayer of Belfast The Franchise Bill however be cut down in the first instance from a measure which dealt with the borough of Ireland generally to one which dealt with the borough of Belfast alone Such a measure however would secure that the popular control should still be exercise in regard to these work and therefore it be consider that the Bill might be allow to go on and the Lords Amendments be accept The Bill which deal with the municipal franchise of Belfast be introduce into this House by the promoter of the Drainage Bill and it pass this House with a clause in it make the first election of the full Town Council of Belfast come into operation during the present year In that form the Franchise Bill go up to the other House of Parliament What Members below the Gangway on this side of the House object to be that the Town Council of Belfast in an unreformed and unregenerate condition should be allow to exercise control over these drainage work But objection have now be take that it be impossible to complete a new Burgess Roll this year so a to secure the election of a Town Council in November next upon the propose new and extended municipal franchise Therefore a I understand an alteration have be make in the provision of the Bill in another place delay for one year the election of the Town Council upon the new and extended franchise Of course if that stand alone without any further change and the Lords Amendments to this Bill be accept we should again lose what have be substantially aim at throughout the consideration of this measure we should entrust the exist Town Council of Belfast with the power of carry out this great scheme although it may not possess the confidence of the ratepayer and although it may not act for the public good of the city There may be great force in the allegation which be make a to the difficulty of make up the Burgess Roll this year and there may be good ground for an Amendment in consequence postpone the election of the new Town Council until next year This question however arise namely what be to be do with this Bill Can we assent to the Lords Amendments in this Bill and give the exist Town Council unrestricted control over these drainage work That be the substantial question we have to consider A clause be now about to be submit to the House for consideration which you Sir have admit to be in Order and I have no doubt that it be in Order because it be consequential in substance if not altogether in form with the provision of the Bill so far a the Lords Amendments be concern That clause be intend and I conceive that it would secure the complete control of the ratepayer of Belfast over the execution of these work The clause provide that No action shall be take for liability incur in respect of the work by this Act authorize unless or until the execution of such work have the consent of the owner and ratepayer of the borough to he express by resolution in the manner direct by Schedule of the Public Health Act which for the purpose of such resolution shall be read and have effect a applicable to the borough and a if the expression mean all person liable to the payment of the general purpose rate or the borough rate If this clause be adopt it will have the effect of bring into operation what be commonly know a the Borough Funds Act and nothing can be do under the Bill until there have be a poll and the wish of the ratepayer have be consult not a restrict body of ratepayer but ratepayer under the large and wide possible franchise get rid altogether of question which relate to compound and for the rate which I believe be largely the custom in the borough of Belfast Therefore what be aim at by those who be in favour of the decision in regard to the execution of the drainage work be give to the ratepayer at large will be secure by the adoption of this clause although it may be find that the reconstitution of the Town Council of Belfast accord to the Franchise Bill a it may come back from the House of Lords will be postpone for a year on the ground of the technical difficulty of get a new Burgess Roll complete before November If the Franchise Bill conies back to this House in that form surely there will be secure to the ratepayer of Belfast complete control over the execution of these work because it be provide by the clause which the Member for North Belfast intend to propose that nothing shall be do and no liability incur unless there shall have be a meeting of the ratepayer hold previously under the Borough Funds Act I be quite aware that Members who think that the subject dealt with by the Drainage Bill ought not to be settle by an unreformed Town Council be in consequence disincline to part with thy measure believe that if they do so part with it the power confer under it may be exercise before the salutary change to be effect by the Municipal Franchise Bill can be introduce I quite understand the position of Gentlemen who hold those view but I think that their objection be meet by the amending clause which stand on the Paper SEXTON Belfast The Gentleman the Chairman of Committees may be able to read these thing good than I do but I do not think he be quite as well acquaint with the character of the Corporation of Belfast and their furtive method of proceed a I be or he would not consider that the clause propose by the Member for North Belfast be any security whatever By the simple method of call a meeting which the Corporation of Belfast be quite capable of do to consider the propose execution of these drainage work at an hour when it would be impossible for large number of the owner and ratepayer of the borough to be present the object and intention of the clause might be altogether defeat COURTNEY The Member forgets that the meeting be to be follow by a poll SEXTON But the poll also may be take at a most inconvenient hour Nothing would be easy than by a device of that kind to defeat the intention of this Bill I be most unwilling therefore to part with the security of an extended Burgess Roll for any other security whatever Let me point out how this clause which the Chairman of Ways and Means admires so much be likely to be carry out The Pollution Committee be compose of certain who follow the lead of Gentlemen opposite and they hold a meeting on the of July at which they pass a Resolution request the Town Council not to study the convenience of the ratepayer but to act in regard to this measure in direct opposition to the declared wish of the people of Belfast The action of the Town Council be not only unfair but inconsistent see that they be create a difficulty a to the point of time where none really exist There be a fear on the part of the people of Belfast that in reference to the propose adoption of Schedule of the Public Health Act effort be still be make to place in the hand of the exist Town Council the power of spend the money involve in the execution of the drainage work That be the whole secret of the matter The Town Council have throughout in a stealthy manner to obtain complete control over the spending of this money and I protest against their be able to secure what they desire by have recourse to any mean and underhand device There can be no two opinion that the interest of the Town Council be directly adverse to those of the ratepayer and I shall certainly resist the Lords Amendments in this Bill to the utmost The real objection of the Town Council to the adoption of an extended and revised franchise be not an objection which apply to this year but to every year Let me call attention to the extraordinary conduct of the promoter of the Bill in this House last year although they have always contend that the measure be urgently require in order to preserve the health of the borough They declare last year that rather than allow the franchise to be reform they be prepare to lose the Drainage Bill altogether Bather than allow the people of Belfast to have the control of their own affair they prefer to allow people to be poison every year By an Amendment insert at their own instance in the Belfast Municipal Franchise Bill the time of qualification for a vote be change from the last day of August to the first day of January in each year The notice in reference to a Parliamentary vote be similar to those for municipal purpose and the Parliamentary list will afford a general basis for the municipal list because the qualification be almost identical The number of inhabitant include in each be from to and one list be quite sufficient for the two qualification Lord in the House of Peers insert an Amendment which ought to put an end to any difficulty see that it provide that the Mayor shall appoint revise barrister to carry out the work of prepare the Burgess Roll on the of July The Burgess Roll consequently ought to be complete in adequate time to allow the election of the Town Council on the new list to take place on the of November a period of four month Why should there be more difficulty in revise the municipal list than in revise the Parliamentary list The Mayor assessor can appoint revise barrister at once they will have ample time to do so I would myself undertake to go to Belfast and revise the Municipal Bill in three week without assistance and under the Franchise Bill four month be leave in which the work can be do It be an attempt to give new life to a condemn body of men a moribund Town Council so a to enable them by an effete vote to control the expenditure of I leave it to the majority which have just oppose the Motion I make for the adjournment of the debate to consider whether it be worth while to force me to proceed with the opposition I propose to offer to the Lords Amendments in regard to which opposition I be unable to say at the present moment whether I be right or not The Franchise Bill may leave the Lords in such a shape a may render it unnecessary for me to move Amendments or it may leave it in such a shape a to compel me to do so At the present moment the Government be not in a position to apply the to this discussion I warn them that they have well make arrangement to increase their supporter to for they will certainly not succeed in carry the Lords Amendments to this Bill unless they take some effectual step to close the discussion upon them SIR WILLIAM HARCOURT Derby I would ask if it be possible to discuss this Main Drainage Bill in the absence of the Franchise Bill As I understand the case it be this This Main Drainage Bill be make dependent to a very great extent upon the Franchise Bill But we be now told that when the Franchise Bill come down from the House of Lords it will contain a clause postpone it operation until next year That on the face of it may not appear unreasonable but I can not say so until we have the Bill before u together with the Amendments which have be make in it and hear the ground upon which those Amendments be supported Members who be in favour of this Bill and oppose to further adjournment say that we can deal with the Lords Amendments to the Franchise Bill when that Bill come down That be all very well but who be to deal with the Lords Amendments suppose that we have give up our control over this Bill and we send back the Franchise Bill with an intimation that we have disagree with the Lords Amendments In that case it would only be for the House of Lords to insist on their Amendments to secure that the opponent of the Franchise Bill should obtain all they want If we once pass this Drainage Bill before the Franchise Bill reach the House of Commons we can have no security that we should be able to secure local for the town of Belfast in time to give the ratepayer control over the large expenditure of public money which be involve in the present Bill I maintain that it be only a reasonable proposal to give to the ratepayer of Belfast and to remove out of the hand of the present Local Authorities the full control over the execution of the franchise work and the cost which will be incur in connection with them Surely it be not intend to treat a question of this kind a a Party question We be deal with what be purely a local demand and what in any English borough be grant a a matter of course You be go to give a now and extend franchise to the inhabitant of Belfast and the exist Corporation of that town object to it and perhaps not unnaturally Therefore it be desirable that this House should not part with the Drainage Bill altogether leave ourselves helpless in reference to the Franchise Bill It have be point out that the argument adduce on the other side in favour of postpone the operation of the Franchise Bill namely the difficulty of prepare a now Burgess List be altogether without foundation I have show that you can not deal with the Lords Amendments now In the first place you might find it necessary to disagree with them If you do so the Bill must go back to the House of Lords and the Lords might insist upon their Amendments in which case the Bill would be abandon I think we ought to have some absolute security that the Amendments postpone the operation of the Franchise Bill be unreasonable and ought not to appear in it Until we have that security we ought not to part with the present Bill I believe there be Gentlemen in this House who can answer for the Corporation of Belfast Then let them get up and give an assurance that they will offer no objection to the Franchise Bill come into operation at once so that the next municipal election in November may be take an the new franchise If they can do that we shall be able to get on with our business If they decline to do so then we must form our own conclusion and take our own security I have think it necessary to make these remark in connection with this matter As the House be aware I be not accustom to take part in the discussion of Private Bills but in this case the discussion be mix up with the consideration of an important public question and I think in the interest of local in Ireland we ought not to refuse the reasonable demand which be make by the Member for West Belfast COLONEL SAUNDERSON Armagh Some time ago I myself bring in a Bill for the purpose of extend the franchise in order to include a large number of the ratepayer of Belfast and I for one be entirely oppose to part with this Bill until we have an absolute certainty that the Franchise Bill will come down from the House of Lords in such a shape a to be entirely satisfactory to the ratepayer of Belfast who I believe be naturally oppose to the expenditure of this large sum of money without have a distinct voice in the matter For my own part I can not see that the delay of a few day I can have any serious effect upon the passing of the Bill At the same time I be indispose to get rid out of our own hand of that leverage which we at present posse of force the Lords to send down to u the Franchise Bill in such a form a will render it acceptable to the people of Belfast Therefore I for one be ready to support the Member for West Belfast Sexton in oppose the Motion for the consideration of the Amendments in the Drainage Bill until we have the Municipal Franchise Bill fully before u MR CHANCE Kilkenny The Gentleman the Chairman of Ways and Means have warn u that under the Belfast Franchise Bill a reconstruct in the House of Lords no election can take place on the extended franchise during the present year He have far say that the ground on which that somewhat peculiar reconstruction of the franchise have take place be that it be find impossible to prepare a new Burgess Boll this year I be very much surprise to hear that statement but I be not surprise to find that an attempt have be make to delay the operation of the Bill for another year Now a a matter of fact no step whatever whether preliminary or otherwise can be take towards the formation of a new Burgess Roll until after the expiration of a particular date and therefore the lateness of the time at which the Bill be pass be absolutely immaterial I have have personal experience in this matter and I say that the statement that there will exist any difficulty in prepare the Burgess Roll be utterly and completely unfounded A more unfounded statement I never hear in my life and I hope the Gentleman the Chairman of Ways and Means who make it will tell u upon what authority he make it and give u at least one reason however paltry in support of it The Gentleman go on to make a still more extraordinary statement He tell u that we have repeatedly postpone the consideration of the Drainage Bill for one object and one object alone namely that the ratepayer of Belfast should have effective control over the expenditure of this He then go on to say that effective control would be give to the ratepayer for the expenditure by the new clause which the Member for North Belfast propose to insert in the Drainage Bill Now that be a clause which direct the Corporation of Belfast to take a sort of mock plebiscite under the Public Health Act of and there be two observation which I desire to make upon that clause The first be that under the clause the ratepayer who do not earn their money in Belfast will be able to swamp the vote of the resident ratepayer of the borough Let me point out another objection What will be the question put to the people when the plebiscite be take It will be simply a question of Yes or No and have vote or No the ratepayer will lose every particle of control over the expenditure of the money That be very different from the control which the people of Belfast will obtain if they get an extended franchise and be able to send their own representative to the Town Council retain in their own hand that control over their representative which the knowledge that further election will be bring about usually secures Secondly the ratepayer of Belfast would under the extended franchise have by right a substantial which would enable them to govern the expenditure of this at every stage The last observation I have to make be this We be ask now to part with this Bill we be ask to part with our sole guarantee for the passing of any franchise whatever We be not in reality deal with the question whether the people of Belfast be to have an extended franchise now or next year That be a pure technicality and fiction The question be whether they be to have a real franchise or none at all and if this Bill be allow to pass now I venture to predict that the Lords will disagree with any Amendments of this House in which we may be compel to express our disagreement with their Amendments In that case the result would inevitably be that the Bill would be throw out and the solo opportunity which the people of Belfast have of get an extended franchise would be defeat The effect would practically be that the repeated vote we have give in this House from a sense of justice towards the people of Belfast will have be absolutely throw away and a long series of year may elapse before we may be in a position again to compel the other House to act fairly towards a class of people who deserve consideration and fair treatment quite as much a the other class which the House of Lords have take under their protection The course which this House take on the drainage question mean franchise or no franchise in Belfast and I hope the House will not be lead away by any ingenious technicality If the question be treat by Members in a spirit of fair play and not a a Party question I be sure we shall be successful in do for the people of Belfast what Her Majesty Government ought to have do long ago of their own motion JOHNSTON Belfast I think the right Member for Derby Sir William Harcourt and my and gallant Friend the Member for North Armagh Colonel Saunderson can not have read the clause which have be place on the Paper by my Friend the Member for North Belfast which give the entire control over the expenditure which be to be incur under this Bill to the ratepayer of the borough It will be necessary to insert an advertisement in all the local newspaper and notice will have to be post up on all the church and chapel convene a meeting of the ratepayer It will therefore be impossible to hold a meeting and it will be competent for anyone to demand a poll when every ratepayer of Belfast will be able to record his vote a to whether this expenditure shall be incur under the drainage scheme or not It have already be point out that a noble Lord in another place who be formerly Lord Lieutenant of Ireland be the cause of the postponement of the Municipal Franchise Bill and that the postponement be not the consequence of any action take by the promoter of the main drainage scheme In my opinion the citizen of Belfast have be make to suffer in their health in order that Gentlemen opposite may be able to pose a the advocate of an extended franchise I be a sincere a supporter of an extended franchise a any Gentleman below the Gangway on the opposite side and therefore I hope the House will not accept the suggestion of the right Member for Derby and the and gallant Member for North Armagh I do not believe in the infallible leadership of anyone and on this occasion I can not follow the and gallant Member for North Armagh I hope the House will not consent to any further postponement of the question especially when the Town Council of Belfast have declare their full intention of act in a bona manner and of give the ratepayer every practical control over the expenditure Indeed I be prepared to pledge myself on their behalf that if the clause which have be place upon the Paper by the Member for North Belfast be insert in the Bill it will be act upon by the Town Council of Belfast in that spirit of perfect good faith which have always characterize their action KENNY Tyrone Mid The only manner in which the Belfast Town Council can act with fairness upon the question be to give the ratepayer of the borough an opportunity of decide by their vote Originally in the Municipal Franchise Bill very excellent machinery be provide for the election of the Town Council But the friend of the Belfast Town Council in another place strike out the whole of that machinery and now the Member for North Belfast propose to insert a new clause which be of an entirely illusory character I will show the House how that be so An extended franchise for Belfast will cover something like ratepayer It be propose to have a plebiscite under the Schedule of the Public Health Act which provide for the call of a general aggregate meeting of ratepayer Now if the whole of the population of Belfast be to meet in order to decide the question of control the expenditure of this under the Schedule of the Public Health Act there would be person present and I should like to know how it would be possible to pack them in the Town Hall of Belfast which be not capable of hold more than All that would have to do would be to bring down men from his own work and pack the meeting when the question would at once be decide against the interest of the majority of the ratepayer and therefore the proposal of the Member seeing that the original machinery provide by the Bill have be strike out by his friend in another place be totally misleading and would leave the people of Belfast in an infinitely bad position than that which they occupy at present Therefore I ask the House not to part with the sole security they now have that the people of Belfast will be allow a fair control in regard to the question DE Belfast I can not help feeling that the Chairman of Ways and Means for whose fairness fearlessness and sense of right in the discharge of his duty I entertain the high respect be mistake upon this particular question In the first instance the adoption of the Lords Amendments in the Franchise Bill will delay the election of a new Town Council in Belfast under an extended franchise not for month but for month see that the new election can not take place until the of November next year Therefore this important scheme with the large expenditure of money it involve would have the start of a year and a quarter of those popular privilege which ought fairly to control the expenditure of the money I confess that I do not often find a ground of agreement with the observation which fell from the right Member for Derby Sir William Harcourt but certainly I think the remark he make that this ought not to be consider a Party question be one which we ought all to agree with I have be reproach for the attitude I have take in act in concert with the Member for West Belfast Sexton I wish to say honestly plainly and frankly that because I differ from the Member and others who sit below the Gangway on the other side of the House in regard to question affect the of the Empire nevertheless so far a they advocate just and wise measure affect their own country I be altogether in concert with them I must say that I consider this argument a most mean and contemptible one Why because the Member for West Belfast happen to differ from me upon the question of the unity of the Empire ought I to oppose him upon some other question which we view from a common standpoint and a common platform and why should we be debar from act together for the promotion of the public good Such an argument be entirely unworthy of the good sense and intelligence of the House of Commons As far a I be concerned I have never allow my public position to descend into that of a mere I shall always advocate public question on public ground and I shall as far a I can decide the merit of such question on the abstract principle of justice altogether apart from the consideration of the person by whom they be advocate or oppose It appear to me that if the suggestion throw out by the right Member for Derby be act upon we might bring these long controversy to a final conclusion The suggestion he make be one that be characterize by equity and fairness namely that we should relegate to the class of Belfast to whom we extend for the first time the municipal privilege they have hitherto be exceptionally deprive of the duty of the Corporation upon an extended basis and of allow them to deal with the question of the public expenditure to be incur under this measure I think it would be unfair and unjust that a moribund Corporation elect on the basis of a narrow franchise should deal with a question which involve the expenditure of money to the extent of and an augmentation of taxation to the extent of per cent I hope therefore the House will see that a an act of fair play and justice to the ratepayer of Belfast it be desirable to defer the final consideration of the present Bill until the ratepayer be invest with their full municipal right I think the Member for West Belfast have fairly state the case We be not fight this Bill On the contrary we sympathize with the object which the promoter of it have in view So far a the Member himself be concern I believe that throe out of every four of the people of Belfast who will be benefit by the extension of municipal privilege be oppose to him in politics and also in religion hence the ground which he have take be a chivalrous ground and I can not understand why the promoter of the Bill who profess to be in touch with the majority of the people of Belfast and who hold identical religious and political sentiment should desire to bar that door which the Member for West Belfast and myself desire to throw wide open in order that they may enjoy their full municipal right and privilege Northampton I only desire to point out that the silence of Members represent the Town Council of Belfast with regard to the appeal make to them by the right Member for Derby Sir William Harcourt be a conclusive reason why the Lords Amendments should not now be consider It be no unreasonable pledge to give if the Corporation of Belfast have no in the matter and mean to carry out bona what have be suggest SIR JAMES Armagh Mid The Member for West Belfast have threaten the House that if it will not consent to a postponement he will keep Members here all night discuss the Lords Amendments SEXTON To secure an adequate discussion of them SIR JAMES I be as earnest in desire an extension of the franchise to the ratepayer of Belfast a the Member and I promote the Municipal Franchise Bill and carry it through this House No doubt Amendments be introduce into it while it be pass through this House which I know would render it unworkable and the consequence be that there be no possibility whatever of the Burgess Roll be revise in time for the election which will take place on the of November next In Belfast on property rat at and under the rate be pay by the owner and not by the occupier and therefore the name of the occupier do not appear in any now in existence That be a reason which render it perfectly impossible to carry the Franchise Extension Bill into operation this year The rate be strike on the of January in each year and therefore the present can not contain the name of the new burgess But when the Bill come down from the House of Lords contain a clause to postpone the election until next year I would propose a a compromise although see the urgency of this measure the Town Council might not feel disposed to do so themselves that a clause should be insert in the Bill to provide that the main drainage scheme shall not come into operation until the new election have take place next year If such a clause be propose then on behalf of the Corporation of Belfast I shall not offer any opposition to it and in that way I hope the whole question may be settle It be perfectly impossible for the Burgess Roll to be revise in a satisfactory way so a to enable the new Town Council to be elect upon it in the present year But a I have say I be quite prepared on my part to give every assistance I can to the postponement of the drainage scheme until next year although I be of opinion that it be urgently necessary to carry it out as speedily a possible If this suggestion be adopt I believe the ratepayer will get all the control they can desire in regard to the expenditure of the money MAURICE Cork I wish to give the most absolute contradiction to the assertion that there would be any difficulty create by a provision in the Franchise Bill require the preparation of the Burgess List for Belfast to be complete in time for the next municipal election I claim to speak with some knowledge and authority upon the point a I have myself be largely concern in the conduct of municipal matter in Ireland So far from make the preparation of the Roll more difficult the Bill which be now in another place would render it more simple and would afford to the local official facility for the preparation of the Roll which have not be enjoy hitherto Let me point out to the House what go on The ordinary period at which the qualification for the municipal franchise be gain be the year end on the of August The Bill which be now in another place in consequence of an Amendment introduce into it by my Friend the Member for West Belfast Sexton provide that the period of qualification so far a the borough of Belfast be concern shall be the year end on the of July What be the effect of that It be impossible for the authority to commence the preparation of the Burgess List until the period of qualification have close consequently although under the exist law it would be impossible for the Municipal Authorities to commence the preparation of the Burgess Roll before the of August yet owe to the Amendment of my Friend they will be able to commence it after the of July so that they have five or six week more to commence the preparation under the provision of my Friend than under the ordinary law Perhaps the House will allow me to call attention to another fact Every difficulty that can exist in regard to the preparation of the Burgess List under the Bill a it now stand will equally exist next year and in every subsequent year The reason be that the date which the authority be to observe in prepare the list of voter be fix by Act of Parliament and those date will be enforce and will be the law next year just a they be now The period for commence the preparation of the Burgess List will be exactly the same next year a this If the Amendment of my Friend be allow to remain a it do change the day of qualification from the of August until the of July it may be possible to commence the preparation of the list after the of this month The present authority will not get a day longer if the preparation of the list be postpone until next year because the day of qualification will still be the of July and they can not set about the preparation of the list a single day earlier than they could set about par it now More than that the period within which the work must be do would be exactly the same Only the same number of day will be allow next year a will be allow in this So much for the argument found upon the difficulty of prepare the Burgess Roll which I assert to be the most impudent of all the pretence which have be set up by the Corporation of Belfast not a bona ground of delay but a a mere pretext for stave off the evil day when the mass of the people of Belfast be to acquire control over their local affair There be only one other observation I desire to make and it be this that the course of procedure which be provide by the propose new clause be a course of procedure which hitherto have not exist in Ireland as far a I be aware but which it be propose to import into that country from an English Act the term of which do not apply to Ireland at all The Schedule of the Public Health Act of make this provision SPEAKER I feel oblige to interrupt the Member I must remind him that it will not be in Order to discuss any particular clause in the Public Health Act What the House have now to consider be the Lords Amendments to the Main Drainage Bill MAURICE I quite appreciate the point you make Sir and I shall not far address the House on that subject The Baronet who have just sit down Sir James have tell u he would offer no objection to an alteration of the Bill now in another place when it come back to u so a to allow the municipal franchise to come into operation before the drainage work be commence next year My reply to that proposal be that the offer will not adequately meet the exigency of the case It be not a question of what the Baronet like or dislike or what he be willing to do or be not willing to do The question be Will he pledge himself to use his influence with his friend in another place to induce them to take the same line of action The offer he have make be one which only bind himself and his friend in place would have very little difficulty in disregard it when the result of our action here be bring before them again for review THE FIRST LORD OF THE TREASURY SMITH Strand Westminster I understand that there be a common understanding between both side of the House that the Franchise Bill should come down to this House from another place before the House part with this Bill That be the case and have pay careful attention to the matter I understand that to be the arrangement I would strongly advise my Friend to postpone the further consideration of this Bill until we get the Franchise Bill from the other House It will then be possible for u to carry out any understand that may be arrive at a between the two side of the House Such a course would in my opinion be fair and reasonable and it would save the time of the House I hope my Friends will accept that suggestion SPEAKER Do I understand the right Gentleman to make any Motion on the subject SMITH Yes I will move that the consideration of the Lords Amendments be far postpone until Tuesday next Belfast rise amid cry of Agreed The Member say I can not agree with the statement that an engagement be enter into that the Franchise Bill should come down to this House before the Drainage Bill be pass Oh The engagement be that progress should have be make with the Franchise Bill However in deference to the appeal which have be make by the Leader of the House I will cheerfully acquiesce in his suggestion SEXTON May I respectfully ask that Thursday should be substitute for Tuesday Although the Franchise Bill may be report it may not be read a third time or Monday and therefore we have no security that it will have come down here by Tuesday JOHNSTON I hope the right Gentleman will adhere to Tuesday SMITH There would be no objection to a further postponement if the Franchise Bill do not come down by Tuesday Belfast Before this Bill be finally dispose of I will with the permission of the House make a few remark a to the position of the promoter A great deal of misapprehension exists a to their action and intention It have be state here and elsewhere that they be oppose to the extension of the municipal franchise in Ireland but than this nothing can be more incorrect and the reverse of that be the truth of the matter May I recall to the memory of the House the fact that my Friend the Member for Mid Armagh Sir James early in the Session introduce a Bill for the assimilation of the municipal franchise in Ireland to that exist in England That be a general Bill extend to all the borough of Ireland That Bill meet with opposition in a quarter from which the House might well be surprise to find it come it be block by Members below the Gangway on the other side SEXTON Belfast I would warn the Member that these remark of his may lead to prolonged debate if he continue thorn I will not occupy the time of the House at length but in justice to myself and the promoter of the Bill I feel bound to give some explanation why we agree to these Amendments to this measure SPEAKER I do not think a general review of the history of the Bill will be in Order SPEAKER report the Royal Assent to several Bills"

appear to be somewhat different the one be the amount of force which the Government think necessary for the service of the country and the other the mode of the administration of those force which be adopt by the Government and the Secretary of State On the present occasion without any intention to delay the Committee by any extended observation he would in the first instance deal with the first of these subject the amount of force which Her Majesty Government propose for the service of the year The Member for Cambridge Fowler have propose to reduce this force to the extent of men He have no hesitation in say at once that he should record his vote in opposition to that Amendment of the Member for Cambridge At the same time he desire to express his regret that Her Majesty Government have think it their duty to reduce the force for the year though he be not quite sure he understand the proposal in reference to the Staff brigade depot to be form from the auxiliary force explain that the real number for the purpose of present comparison be and not the increased number of because the be future men who or a portion of whom would become soldier of the brigade depot a the permanent Staff now employ upon the Militia be gradually absorb Therefore they would not come into existence until there be a corresponding reduction or a more than correspond reduction in the permanent Staff of the Militia SIR JOHN I may speak of them a Militia to be gradually draft into the Army And add to the Army a they be absorbed SIR JOHN say that this question of the amount of the force ought to be discuss without reference to party or political feeling It be the clear duty of the Government of the day to provide a force sufficient for the requirement of the country and no Minister would be justify in propose any force that he honestly think would be below the fair requirement of this great Empire but at the same time they be not justify in exceed those requirement by a single man He therefore deprecate party or what he might call popularity Motions on the subject It be not very difficult in the absence of any emergency to estimate our military requirement The Member for Hackney have take the total amount of the Estimates and divide that by the total number of men have calculate the cost per man Such a mode of calculation be obviously fallacious at any time and especially at present consider the way in which our force be arm and many other matter There be only one way of fairly test the Estimates of different Governments in respect to the Army and that be by judging of the number of men propose for the Army He wish to go back as far a the last year of the Government of Lord Russell when the present Prime Minister be Chancellor of the Exchequer and the present Chief Secretary for Ireland be Secretary of State for War In the noble Marquess the Marquess of ask Parliament to grant exclusive of the men serve in India men for the Army He take for his comparison the number of our own British troop on the face of the Estimates He do not remember that any objection be raise to that proposal a be in any degree excessive or beyond what the fair requirement of the Empire demand Soon afterwards a change of Government occur and General Peel succeed the noble Marquess at the War Office On General Peel retirement he himself Sir John succeed to that Department and in it be his duty a the then Secretary of State for War to introduce the Army Estimates for the year The number of men he propose in be or in round figure about men few than the noble Marquess opposite the Marquess of have propose two year before It be also in that the right Gentleman now at the head of the Government make that tour in Lancashire which have not be forget and very naturally desire to show why the late Ministry should go out and the present Ministry should go in and hero he must confess he have always regret that the right Gentleman instead of rest his case on the broad difference of policy between the two contending party have charge the late Government with extravagance in expenditure He himself have always warmly deny that accusation and he think the figure he be quote show that so far a the Army be concern there be no justification for make it the number of men which he propose in be few than have be propose by the previous Government However the right Gentleman opposite have think proper to say so much about the extravagance of his opponent that when he again come into Office it be necessary that something should be do to fulfil the expectation he have raise Now he desire to allude and he hop to do it in no offensive manner to the administration of the present Secretary of State for War during the last four year because it could not be deny that for good or for harm his administration have be most remarkable That he be perfectly free to acknowledge Let them look at that administration financially and what would they find He do not say in consequence of those Lancashire accusation but immediately after them in at one fell swoop a reduction of men be propose Again when the Estimates of be lay before Parliament away go men more and during those two year under the administration of his right Friend opposite between and be strike off from the strength of the Army Well the year have not pass away before of those men have to be put on again dissent His right Friend shake his head but the proposal of the Government in be to add men to the Army in round number so that within about eighteen month from the change of Government men be reduce and men be put back again and in the Estimates of his right Friend be within men of the number he have himself propose in There be an old say Let bygone be bygone and he do not want to dwell on that subject unnecessarily but he do say that to his mind those fluctuation those sudden up and down be unworthy and undignified Successive Governments ought to arrive a he believe they might arrive at something like a clear understanding of what be the force require in ordinary peaceful time for the defence of this great Empire and they ought to maintain that force No Government of the day ought to allow itself to be dictate to by any quarter or ought to think it be it interest to play those trick with the strength of the Army It would be his duty to vote against the Motion of the Member for Cambridge Fowler for he have hear nothing like an argument to justify the reduction which that Gentleman propose Indeed he have not hear from the Secretary of State himself any good reason for the reduction of men which he now propose Why be these men to be reduce Were they superfluous last year If so why be the House ask to vote them If they be not superfluous last year why be they superfluous now He never have like and he do not like now the policy of the present Government in bring back so many troop from the colony One obvious consequence of it be that in the ratio in which they reduce their force in the colony they increase it at home Thus they have what seem to be a very large force to meet the requirement of this country and those who wish to reduce the Army take the number of men they saw quarter at home and apparently without occupation for their time a the basis of their argument He do wish that the present Government and all Governments would take a steady line of policy ascertain what amount of force we really required and would then keep to it whatever it might be They ought not to be induce by the passing politics of the day to make those constant change knock off thousand of men in one year and put them on again the next year He next wish to refer to the administration of the Army during the last two year Within that time they have have four of the most remarkable change that have occur for a long period in that administration They have have that great measure a he admit it to be for good or for evil abolish the system of purchase next the term of service in the Army have be shorten thirdly they have have that great withdrawal of troop from the colony to which he have already and their concentration at home and lastly come the Act for amalgamate our Auxiliary Forces with the Regular Army and establish those depot centre which he be glad to hear from his right Friend statement the other night would in a short time be commence and which he hop would be rapidly bring into active exercise His right Friend have pursue a bold policy and if it prove successful a for the sake of the country everyone must desire he would be entitle to the honour of these change The most hazardous one of them be the abolition of purchase He think it from the first a very costly experiment but if it succeed no one would have a right to complain of the cost The anxiety and doubt however with which he originally view the measure have not yet be remove He have be disappoint in not hear his right Friend explain the inevitable consequence of the change on our system of promotion and retirement It might be premature to press for his decision a respected retirement but it be clearly the right and duty of his side of the House to solicit explanation from time to time a to the manner in which the change be be carry out and he hop to hear a statement a to promotion to the command of regiment Much be say in the discussion on purchase of seniority temper by selection but the information within reach of the public have lead him to suppose that seniority have decide appointment to high post and to the command of regiment and that there have be little if any selection The next great change be the system Now it be not satisfactory to find desertion so prevalent a to excite general anxiety and he would ask whether any measure be in contemplation to check the evil He be not sanguine of the success of the system and he wish to know how it be to be reconcile with service in India The Government have resolve to supply the Indian Army with seasoned soldier not with boy of He think the House do not fully understand from his right Friend answer on Monday night how the be to be regulate and how the supply of soldier of proper age be reconcile with the system Turning to the next great change a to which he have not to adopt the same tone of objection he felt sanguine that his right Friend scheme for the amalgamation of the force at home and in depot centre would prove the best adopt by any War Minister for many year It would tend to make the troop much more effective and he hop that in time the harmonious whole anticipate by his right Friend would be bring about so that the Auxiliary Forces and the Regulars would work together on a more satisfactory footing As to link battalion he be one of those who in company with much more competent men urge on his right Friend the reduction of the number of regiment and the adoption of that plan The change require an effort but his right Friend have do so many bold thing that this could not be deem beyond his power He wish to know whether his new plan be a fair substitute for the old system and whether any serious difficulty be likely to arise in combine different regiment He hop that in any case the object in view would be persevere in He have be glad to find that the apparent reduction in the Militia Vote which seem at first to imply a reduction of the Force be the result of the transfer of two considerable item to another Vote Nothing should induce his right Friend to swerve from the resolution display throughout his administration of keep up the Militia Possibly a similar explanation might account for the reduction of in the Volunteer Vote for he be sure the country would regret any fall off in the numerical strength or efficiency of this valuable Force He have hear with satisfaction the right Gentleman state the other evening that certain stoppage in the pay of the soldier be to be abolish but the right Gentleman go on to state that the soldier would consequently receive clear He be afraid there be some mistake with regard to the latter statement and he wish to afford the right Gentleman an opportunity of correct a misapprehension which if allow to get abroad would cause the soldier to believe that the promise of the Government be not be fulfil and that they be not deal with him in good faith He have that morning receive an anonymous letter sign A Soldier which have be post at Manchester and which be evidently write by a person in humble life in which it be point out that the soldier would still have to pay for his grocery vegetables barrack damage and sheet washing which would cost him altogether leave him only a clear pay of instead of the shilling mention by the right Gentleman He should be glad if the right Gentleman would set this matter right in order to prevent a misunderstanding with regard to it He would not trouble the Committee with any more observation far than to say that above and before all he most earnestly hop that whatever Government might be in power they would not yield to these periodical proposal to reduce the Army by men or to raise it by men but would steadily adhere to that force and that force only which the requirement of this great country demand CAPTAIN BEAUMONT say he be not dispose to vote in favour of the Motion of the Member for Cambridge in it present form but he should have be prepare to support it have it propose to pass men from the Regular Army into the Reserve in accordance with the term of a Motion he have bring forward about two year since He object to any Motion for a lump reduction of men and think that even if the House of Commons consider a reduction necessary it should be leave to the War Office to decide upon the detail By pursue the course he indicate the service of the men would have be retain while the Estimates might have be considerably reduce He be glad to hear that the question of the soldier pay have at length be dealt with in a manner which have meet with the unqualified approval of both side of the House He suggest however that the soldier should be make to pay for his uniform as well a his a due allowance be of course give him for the purpose Such a reform would encourage him to be more careful with his clothes than he be at present He have also hear with satisfaction that the detail of the Army scheme would be forthcoming in the course of next month There be one or two omission in the speech of the right Gentleman He be sorry in the first place that the right Gentleman have not allude to the question of the stagnation in promotion that now exist in the Ordnance Corps In point of promotion the junior rank of that branch of the service be bad off than before the recent promotion of first captain to major because the senior rank be now so attractive that men could not be get to leave them The proposal of the Government for the abolition of purchase be support by himself and other Members on the understanding that for the purchase system some scheme would be substitute which would provide for the efficiency of the service a regard Until the question of the stagnation of promotion have be grapple with he could not look upon the abolition of purchase a a satisfactory settlement He wish to call the attention of the Committee to the fact that although the Estimates have be reduce the economy which have be effect have be the result of strike so many fight men off the more than the result of increase efficiency which be the proper source to look to for economy He be also disappoint in not hear from the right Gentleman a statement a to the mode in which he propose to deal with the question of promotion in the Army generally With regard to the system of short service contemplate by the right Gentleman the Secretary of State for War he could only say that it differ very materially from the system advocate by the Member for Hackney with whom he be dispose to agree The short service which the Member for Hackney and himself approve be such a system a would pass men rapidly from the rank into the Reserve The present system of short service appear to him to be wrong for two reason In the first place we have under that system enlistment for the Regular Army and at the same time enlistment for the Militia A process which could hardly be conducive to efficiency In the next place six year service give a man a taste for military life and unfit him for the duty of a civilian If they accept the principle of short service they must accept that which have be recognise here and on the Continent namely that in three year a man be make a soldier and they must also recognise the fact that the remainder of his vice must be pass in the Army Reserve to secure discipline and efficiency The country do not care whether they be defend by the Regular Army or by the Reserve He believe that if a system of three year service together with sufficient pay in the Reserve be fairly try the War Department would get a sufficient number of men He must congratulate the right Gentleman upon the first step which he have take towards decentralization and he hop the Government would go far in that direction and establish complete localized Army corp HERBERT protest against the whole system on which our Army be found His right Friend try to do the best he could with that system but the system in itself be radically wrong It possess only one good feature it could not possibly last and it have three great defect it be expensive it be immoral and a a weapon of offence or defence it be inefficient As to it cost he would say nothing The naked figure at the foot of these Estimates speak for themselves But he would call attention to the second point The number of desertion have already be matter for comment His right Friend reckon that the number in be and it have be say that this could hardly be the full number a over be advertise in The Police Gazette He wish however to show the ratio of increase during the last year It be true that in the number of desertion be as high a per thousand but in the intervening year it vary from to a maximum of till in it spring up to per thousand In his opinion this mean that at the present time the rate of wage be increase that good mean of employment be afford to the labouring class and that they be become more and more disinclined to accept the pitiful term offer them for military service It be well know that men who have fall into misfortune take refuge under the system of compulsion of enter the Army and the result show itself in the number of desertion Another point to which he wish to call the attention of the Committee be that there be good ground for believe that the class from which our recruit be draw be and that the men be not equal to those who formerly enter the Army The statistic of show an increase proportion of young soldier who have but shortly join the service and who be commit to military prison In the percentage of those who have only serve two year and under in comparison with the whole number of soldier admit into military prison be per cent In and the same percentage be show but in it leap up to per cent These figure show unmistakably that the class of men who have lately join the Army be a deteriorate class Then what be the state of the whole Army a regard crime The Report of state that sentence by have be pass which be at the rate of man in every a state of thing which the most sanguine admirer of our military system could not regard a satisfactory In consider these figure it should be remember that the punishment award by be always severe and that they do not include penalty for small breach of military discipline These small offence number a percentage of percent this number be perhaps less surprising than the number of punishment for serious offence especially when it appear that of the latter be for period of from to year imprisonment But besides this the Inspector General of Prisons have state that the amount of crime would have be great but for the fact that the bad character the habitual offender against military law have be discharge from the Army in and As many a of these utterly bad character be discharge in the year end with April and be discharge in the following year He would now tread upon somewhat more delicate ground by show the state of immorality in the Army This immorality he believe form another ground for suspect the soundness of the system on which it be found Few would credit the fearful amount of venereal disease exist among the men an average of no less than admission to hospital of syphilitic case be report per men and per of the more serious form of the disease COLONEL STUART KNOX rise to Order He wish to know whether those detail be necessary THE CHAIRMAN say the Gentleman be do nothing contrary to the Rules of the House and must be leave to the exercise of his own discretion COLONEL STUART KNOX Or to common decency HERBERT contend that it be urgently necessary to lay these statistic before the House and the country and he have not the slight intention of refrain from submit them They should have be study long ago and he be convince when once the country become aware of the immorality produce by our present military system no Government could hold it hand from reform it The case per however do not show the extent of the evil The Reports of the various medical Inspectors assert that this disease have be much reduce by the operation of certain Acts One Inspector think the disease have be reduce by them and the Inspector at Colchester report that the great immunity from disease exist since be entirely attributable to those Acts Prior to he report admission per and in only per So that large a be the admission to hospital at present they do not disclose more than a small part of the great immorality lurking in our military system These be very unsavoury detail and quite a unpleasant to him a to any other Member Would the House and the country allow a system which could foster such immorality to continue He wish to say distinctly a he have say before that the system on which the Army be base combined three great evil it be an enormously expensive system it be a grossly immoral system and he venture to add that a a mean of defence it be altogether inefficient Foreign critic might come over to this country and under the influence of the urbanity and hospitality of the Minister for War pas some favourable criticism upon a few point connect with our Army but he refuse to believe any general of reputation on the Continent would pronounce our stand Army fit to oppose the citizen Army of a nation equally intelligent and as powerful a England in other the system upon which we rely render it utterly impossible SIR LAWSON say that the discussion they have have that night be not a very lively one nor be the subject of the last speech very pleasant and he do not wonder that hour ago there be find Gentlemen from both side of the House to vote that the debate should be give up He venture to think however that it be well that they have one more night debate because all would admit that it be most important to discuss thoroughly freely and fully not merely the detail but the policy on which those Estimates be found The Prime Minister very truly tell the House that this Vote be connect with the policy of the Government therefore the House of Commons be only do it duty in give that policy a calm investigation because when once these men be vote there be virtually an end of any important discussion of the Estimates The position in which the Committee find itself tonight be a very peculiar one On the first day of the Session in the Speech which the Queen deliver by the advice of her Ministers Her Majesty inform Parliament that she have the satisfaction of maintain relation of friendship with foreign Powers throughout the world and that be certainly a very satisfactory announcement And yet in that state of thing when we be at peace with all the world and well protect by a most powerful fleet we be call on to provide for the defence of the country twice a many men a we think sufficient before the Crimean War and this at a time when we have withdraw our troop from the colony and when we be live under a Government which come into office on the policy of retrench the public expenditure He freely admit though the admission might be damage to his view that there be no outcry in the country against the military expenditure of the Government So much the Government might say for itself It be not right therefore for the right Gentleman who speak so ably that night in a rather thin House to say that those who be advocate retrenchment be seek a cheap popularity The expenditure of the Government be not unpopular and therefore it be all the more important that those who it should lift up their voice The right Gentleman the Secretary of State for War in his conclude remark on bring in the Estimates say that in prepare the Estimates it be the most sincere desire of Her Majesty Government to be as economical a be consistent with the efficiency of the service and to see that the people of the country get the full value for their money He also say that both in public and private life there be two thing to go together one be that we should show by our conduct that we desire to live on term of peace with our neighbour and the other be that we should make other people equally desirous of living in peaceable relation with u He Sir Lawson believe the right Gentleman be carry out economy and efficiency satisfactorily but he doubt very much whether the right Gentleman be take the best way to bring about that peace which he desire The right Gentleman say that the way to procure peace be to keep up in this country arm men He must take leave to doubt that policy His and gallant Friend Colonel who make such a good speech last night a he always do cheer him ironically for the and gallant Gentleman have say that the proper thing be to be prepare for war No man know modern history well than his and gallant Friend But let him look at France at Austria at all of them nation which have devote themselves to keep up large stand army and prepare for war and the result be that within a few year they have be engage in deadly conflict The question now be be there any necessity to keep enormous force in this country Lord Derby speak not long ago with that good sense which always characterise everything he say observe that the first thing to be do when they talk about Army organization and efficiency be to ascertain what they really want that Army to do Now he want to find that out from his right Friend He try last year and ho could not What do his right Friend want this enormous number of men to do We have give up the policy of assist distressed nationality many of his Friends think wrongly and of go abroad like to defend the weak against the strong We have give up the old policy and now we merely write meddle and muddle despatch which generally make thing rather bad than they be before We do not want any troop to go and protect Turkey We have have enough of that When we wish to interfere now we call a few gentleman round a green table and get the thing settle and he believe the new policy be good than the old Before we use to go to war first and then make a Treaty Now we make a Treaty first and thus avoid go to war Neither do we want to redress the balance of power for he be happy to say that the Government to their everlasting credit keep this country out of the great Continental War three year ago The Baronet the Member for Maidstone Sir John Lubbock have tell an amuse story illustrative of that policy to his constituent It be this A man meet his landlord one day and ask what the news be Oh reply the landlord not mind what he say the Dutch have take Holland Well say the farmer I reckon we shall have to put them out of that pretty quick Now that policy have be do away with and instead of invade other country our only policy be to make peace Our policy be when war be over between other country to supply the starve population with food a policy which would go far than anything else we could do to promote peace His Friend the Member for Hertfordshire Mr Brand make a thundering speech last night and say that we ought to be prepare because the Central Asia question might be troublesome But who care about the Central Asia question No one but a few writer in the Press No Government would dare to go to war for such a matter or any that do would be hurl from power by the people of this country Therefore our Army must be keep up entirely for defence not defiance The motto of our old standing Army might be defiance but that of the Volunteers be defence Another argument of his right Friend be that this great force be keep up to get rid of panic and he say that the age of panic be go He do not believe a word of it What could reasonable measure do to stop panic Panic be the child of We have hear before that the Militia would stop panic Then we be tell that the fortification would put an end to panic and then the Volunteers But ever since we have no end of panic That be the case against whom be we provide those enormous military force Not against France nobody be afraid of France now and he would not insult the Committee by talk of it Not against we know have no fleet to speak of while we have an enormous fleet and have quite enough on her hand in look after France If the Minister of War would get up and give his word that he know a a Cabinet Minister that there be some intrigue go on that some nation in some part of the world be plot against our peace then he would not vote with his Friend the Member for Cambridge Fowler But if the right Gentleman would not tell the Committee that he would believe the word of Her Most Gracious Majesty that we be a she say maintain relation of friendship with foreign Powers throughout the world His right Friend on the March use these word If we be to maintain our influence among nation perform our obligation protect our colony then this House and the people of this country must be of opinion that in the presence of enormous military Monarchies an Army something on the scale of that which be propose for this great country of England be not disproportionate or absurd There be the cloven foot It would appear from that observation that the right Gentleman want u to compete with the large military monarchy on the Continent That would be a dangerous if not a fatal policy What be the use of run this mad race with the Continental Powers in regard to armaments The right Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition on the of July recommend an arrangement between England and France with regard to their national rivalry say What be the use of diplomacy what be the use of Governments what be the use of cordial understanding if such thing can take place These be wise word and he wish the country have attend to them more at the time But if his right Friend want to compete with the military monarchy of the Continent he have far too few men He keep up force enough to irritate not to overawe to make u hat rather than fear to make u suspect not respect Of course he should be tell invasion be possible and he admit it But so be an earthquake The Japanese Ambassadors who have lately visit u remark in a book they publish that they wonder what all the inhabitant of London would do in their house in the case of au earthquake Perfect security be absolutely impossible in this world They must be guide by probability in their movement They be all liable to an attack every day of their life but they do not on that account go out to walk with chain armour round their body He for instance might be assail any day by a combination of infuriated licensed victualler and in the same way the Member for Derby Bass might be set upon by some rabid nevertheless neither of them think it necessary to take the precaution of go about fully arm What be the use of spending year after year all these million in get up this enormous military machinery By keep up an enormous Army we be incur certain evil to ward off problematical one But there be a high view to take than that of expense We rob peace of half it blessing by resort to those mean of defence from remote apprehension of war Such a policy stimulate fresh and unhealthy excitement and unfitted our people for the pursuit of peaceful industry It appear to him absolutely revolt that in when so much be say of religion and civilization Europe should be fill with arm men who devote all their best energy to manufacture machine for the destruction of the life and property of their To indulge in such a course be bad than the action of wild beast The wild beast allow their angry passion to rise but those passion subside They do not like mankind spend their whole life in prepare for slaughter one another This continue maintenance of large armament which be force up by a mad rivalry of other nation be the monster curse of Europe at this moment Was it not a noble course for u to set an example of peace and contentment to all the world He ask his right Friend he ask the be it absolutely necessary to enter on this senseless controversy and to continue it We should engage in some more noble strife we should aim not to be strong but good than other country Why should the beautiful line quote by the Chancellor of the Exchequer with reference to Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen not be apply with equal truth to the country she govern Her armour be her honest thought And simple truth her shield And it would be so if they only adopt an honest straightforward manly policy say about year ago There be a vacant niche in the Temple of Fame for the Ruler or Minister who shall be the first to grapple with this monster evil of the day He hop that the Prime Minister would yet qualify himself to fill that niche He think that the right Gentleman have the power of occupy that splendid position and he be sure that he have the will and the ability to achieve it To his Government belong the honour of initiate the policy of international arbitration Disarmament follow arbitration as certainly a night follow day If the right Gentleman the Prime Minister would but adopt this policy and carry it out to it completion he would not only lighten the burden of his own country but he would do something towards fulfil that prayer which we often put up for the give to all nation of unity peace and concord MAJOR GENERAL SIR PERCY HERBERT say he must remind the Gentleman who sneer at the tone of this debate that if he really desire to attain the object which he and his Friends have in view they should have take a different course and bring forward a Resolution call on the Government to take back their Estimates and them They could then have approach the subject free from matter of detail Some uneasiness have be express in consequence of certain statement which fell from the right Gentleman the Secretary of State for War and he should be glad if they be explain Soldiers of the Guards seem to fear that they would be liable to some diminution of pay in consequence of their ration be stop He believe that be an error although they would not gain so much a soldier of the Line the gain of the one be only one halfpenny per day while the other gain three halfpenny With regard to the pay of men go on furlough the amount they be entitle to be in advance The practice have be that the officer on his own responsibility advance them the great proportion of their pay because it be impossible to subsist upon and know their men and wish to be on good term with them they run the risk of any loss that might occur from desertion and make the advance If the men desert the pay be stop out of the pocket of the captain By the arrangement now propose by the right Gentleman the Secretary of State for War the difference between the regular pay of the soldier and the pay on furlough be only He hop the right Gentleman would this arrangement a it be not worth the discontent it would cause There be many soldier who be employ away from their regiment orderly and who receive their full pay These men must have some allowance and he hop their case would receive liberal consideration He hop discretion would be use in apply the rule a to stop the pay of men in hospital for certain disorder or there would be danger of disease be conceal lead to serious consequence As to brand the men with the letter D it should be understood that officer do not want to mark them for the purpose of retain them in the service but for the purpose of prevent their Next a to the number of recruit Information on that point be incomplete without the standard and he hop the right Gentleman would tell the Committee what the standard be Another point to which he have to advert be that of the examination of the men He believe examination have be do away with two or three year ago and men be allow to come into the Army many of whom a he have be inform by Militia officer be unfit for service in consequence of be unsound The Member for Hertfordshire Mr Brand wish to abolish the Militia in order to have a large Reserve Now thoroughly train men in service be of course more valuable than Militia men But how be they to be obtain The Militia should not be sacrifice for the sake of grasp at a Reserve which take time to acquire He have be amuse at one remark which have fall from the Member for Hertfordshire that as far a economy go he would vote for the Motion of the Member for Cambridge Fowler As a matter of economy they could all vote for the reduction of the Army Estimates by or by several million The only reason for vote the Estimates at all be to maintain the defence of the country The reduction of men this year if follow up by the Amendment of the Member for Cambridge would render a Reserve impossible for how with successive reduction could a considerable number of men pass through the rank and form the Reserve They should remember also what service this Army be call on to perform They have first of all to furnish a supply of troop to India there be always several battalion on the way backwards and forward between the two country and they might at any moment be call upon to send battalion to India How be those battalion to be got How be the reduction propose by the Member for Cambridge to be carry out Were the garrison to be withdraw We have already withdraw our troop from the colony except from those part necessary for maintain our naval supremacy Did he want the garrison to be withdraw from Malta and Gibraltar That might give him his men Or do he want the garrison to be withdraw from Halifax and Bermuda which might give him or men or from the Mauritius and the Cape If we withdraw the troop from Bermuda and Halifax what men have we to defend our great colony of Canada A great deal be to be say in favour of withdraw our troop from an extended line and the Canadian line be a very indefensible line but from Bermuda and Halifax we could carry on war and bind over the Americans to keep the peace to u and our possession The Baronet Sir Lawson who seem to think the defence of the country of no consequence have parade the large number of men under arm a calculate to lead to war but what mean do they afford u of aggressive war and what possibility or probability be there of the Militia and Volunteers be send abroad An invasion be not very probable though it be more probable than an and be a contingency against which we be bind to provide and he would ask whether the Volunteers and Militia could be expect to make a stand alone against a large body of Regular troop Had the Baronet be asleep during the last two or three year Had he not hear of the painful sad and distress position of France when leave to the resource of Volunteers and Militia and be we to be in the same position Were we not to have a small leaven of Regular Forces in the country Considering the number of foreign station to be hold surely the force be not excessive he hop therefore the Committee would not countenance any proposal to reduce it I do not see in his place my Friend the Member for Carlisle Sir Lawson who make so interesting and agreeable a speech or I should remind him that the conversation near the close of which he find great fault with the largeness of the Army begin in the same and kindly manner by my right Friend and predecessor criticize the smallness of this year Estimates I hope therefore he will see that that hateful object in his eye the Minister for War have adversary to contend with both on the right and the left and that it be not altogether his fault if he be not able to give entire satisfaction to everybody My Friend Sir Lawson say he be open to a bribe If I would reveal to him a secret of the Government and inform him that some foreign State be deeply meditate some extremely dangerous project and that we therefore require an unusually excessive force he promise me his vote against the Amendment of my Friend the Member for Cambridge Fowler I be sorry to say that I must be content to forego the honour and pleasure of my Friend vote I can give him no such information I venture only to recommend these Estimates on the ground that they be just and moderate that they be not in any sense excessive when you consider the greatness of this country and the duty which it have to discharge and that our desire be not only to live peaceably ourselves with everybody around u but to maintain preparation so commensurate with our duty and position that others respect u will be equally desirous of living peaceably with u It be in that and in no other spirit that these Estimates have be frame And now Sir little remain for me but to answer the many question put to me as briefly a I can and then to turn to the Motion of my Friend the Member for Cambridge And first I will notice the friendly observation of the right Member for opposite Sir John He charge me in the most manner possible with have bring in Estimates merely for the purpose of fulfil pledge which some Members of the Government have give with regard to economy with turn off men one year from motif of popularity and then immediately take on the same men again Now there be this much foundation certainly for the charge that we do begin with considerably reduce Estimates found upon these consideration that we think it right to withdraw our force from the colony and concentrate them at home a policy on which the right Gentleman who have just sit down agrees with u and differs from his right Friend who sit beside him Another be that we immediately set to work to get up our Reserves and although we reduce the total number of force for which the taxpayer pay we have in this country when the German War break out a far more considerable force a I show at the time then we should have have have we rest upon the more costly proportion of But then my right Friend say we take back the same men Major General Sir PERCY HERBERT You then take boy I beg to say there be no ground for the supposition of the right and gallant Gentleman and we be in a position to discharge the duty we have undertake Well we certainly do increase our force we be not unconscious of the circumstance of the time but we do not take back the men we have part with We do not take back the two West Indian regiment We do not take back the Canadian Rifles whom we have assist to maintain at the expense of this try for the defence of Canada Nor do we take back the Cape Mounted Rifles an excellent force but not as competent a the Cape Mounted Police to discharge frontier duty The truth be what we do be to have a much large number of battery of Artillery of company of Engineers of regiment of Cavalry and of battalion of Infantry at home They be attenuate regiment because have Reserves at home it would have be an unwise policy not to have them attenuate Then my right Friend say he hop we shall pursue a steady line in future I venture to assure him that so long a I have the honour to conduct the office in which I at present serve I shall be guide by the same principle by which we have be guide hitherto namely of make our arrangement efficient a regard the service and the defence of the country and at the same time as economical a we can with regard to the taxpayer The right Gentleman also ask me some question and I will speak first with regard to what have be say in reference to the new system of stoppage I entirely agree that nothing could be more unfortunate than that there should be the slight misunderstanding on the subject Nothing could be more mischievous than to hold out by any careless expression expectation which could not afterwards be realize But I do think that the other evening I exclude the matter from all possibility of misapprehension since I not only state what the stoppage be to which I refer but I also state the precise amount and I use a phrase which have reference expressly to that namely that the soldier be to receive a clear shilling I do not mean a clear shill out of everything ho might be call upon to expend whatever it might be I be speak of the and of that only and I say that the Infantry instead of receive would now receive a clear shilling I perceive there be an expectation in the mind of some person that the grocery stoppage would be exclude also Well that be not a stoppage of the same nature a the stoppage for bread and meat ration The bread and meat stoppage be universal through the Army and be compulsory The grocery stoppage be merely a matter of account within the regiment with this exception that at certain place the mess find it cheap to obtain their grocery from the Control department and in those special case it be a matter of account with the War Office Where that arrangement prevails there be the stoppage to which I refer of a day for that special convenience What I mean and say be that the soldier be to have a shilling clear that be of the bread and meat ration of Again I find that some person apprehend that in some particular case an actual loss will accrue to the soldier from the new arrangement That I negative I can assure them that there be not the small intention of inflict any loss whatever upon anyone by reason of the change in question My right Friend ask me what we be do with regard to promotion and retirement Well with regard to retirement I have always say that I do not think it would be prudent or proper to introduce any new plan of retirement for the Line generally until the arrangement with respect to the purchase system have work for a few year or while the stimulus derive from the sale of commission be go on because to do so would give rise to vested interest and future claim which would be detrimental to the public interest But this I will say with regard to promotion and retirement that we have succeed in solve a very difficult question a respect the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers which a my right Friend say the other evening he have bequeath to me a a question of great importance and difficulty My Friend the Member for Durham Captain Beaumont complains of the stagnation of promotion in these corp I have before me a list of the time at which the junior officer be promote What we aim at be that the should be promote after year The junior of the Royal Artillery be actually promote after year the junior of the Royal Engineers after year and four month the junior major of the Royal Artillery and the junior major of the Engineers each after while what we aim at be year The junior captain of Royal Artillery be eight month in advance of the time so far what my Friend say be true that officer motion be after year and eight month while that of the junior captain of the Royal Engineers be after year and two month So that we have keep very closely to that which we have set before u Now with regard to the mode in which selection have be carry on Promotion have be by seniority temper by selection There have be an infusion of selection but it have be principally by seniority and those who remember what occur in the debate will bear me out entirely when I say that the expectation hold out have only be fulfil by that result I believe it have give general satisfaction in the Army and that there be confidence in the Army in the mode of promotion which the now system have bring into operation and I be sure that by it many old and deserve officer who have be frequently purchase over have derive the benefit which they would not otherwise have derive of receive their legitimate promotion I be ask whether the check to recruit which occur in the course of last year be due to short service Now I hold in my hand the Report of the Inspector General of Recruiting which deal with that subject on both side but he end by quote statistic which show that the number of recruit during the last two year have not be injuriously affect by enlistment for short service With regard to service in India it may be easily reconcile with short service The arrangement make with the Indian Government contemplate that a man might be send to India provide that he have two full year to serve when he get there Under this arrangement few wife and child would be send out few invalid would come home and a variety of consideration of this kind convince the Indian Government that the arrangement be one to which they need not object especially a by the plan of double battalion and by the introduction of system into the provision of for India we expect to be able to comply with the declared wish of this House in that recruit should not be send to India until after they have be season and prepare for service there In this way we hope to reconcile the system of short service with a proper system of relief for India Then I be ask whether we have go far enough in the arrangement with regard to link battalion arrangement fully explain in the Report circulate yesterday morning As I state last year the close the tie between those battalion can be draw the more I shall be gratify But everybody know and I be sure the military men here present will feel it strongly in deal with anything so sacred to the feeling of the Army a the existence of the regiment it be our bounden duty to proceed with the great caution This question be very carefully consider by the high military authority It be with the entire sanction of his Royal Highness the Field Marshal and of other eminent military men who take counsel with him upon the subject that the arrangement contain in the Report which be on the Table be adopt From the time when the new who have be appoint under the new system become the officer of the brigade I think the union will be complete But no doubt during the interval a in all transition we must be content with an imperfect adaptation to the object We have adopt what we believe to be the best and most practical mean and if the officer do not find the exact arrangement now make be the best for their convenience but that the connection may advantageously be make a close one we shall be ready to meet their view Then I be ask by the Member for Cheltenham Samuelson whether we mean to include in the same system the two Militia regiment in the same brigade Where both regiment belong to the same county I shall be dispose to take the same course a in the Regular Army that be to say to appoint the junior officer not to the individual regiment but to the brigade In the case of regiment already exist there might be a difficulty and I think we should not proceed differently from what we propose in the Army unless we carry along with u the feeling of officer in the regiment The next question put to me be whether the reduction in the Militia Vote be to be regard a evidence of an intention to diminish the number of the Militia or whether it be due entirely to the transfer of considerable sum from one Vote to another The main cause of the reduction be the latter We think that when the Militia be to be brigade with the Line since the Transport service be to be perform by my right Friend the Surveyor General for the Militia as well a for the Line there ought to be no separation between them and that they ought to appear under the same head The only reduction if it can be call a reduction be this we be engage in make a great increase in the Militia and have not complete the whole of it I therefore take the number give me by the Inspector General of the Auxiliary Forces a the large to which he could expect to attain during the present year and estimate the amount accordingly The same remark apply to the Volunteers Allowances in lieu of forage and of lodge be transfer to Vote and I express my belief the other evening when I introduce the Estimates that far from bring about a permanent reduction the little increased stringency in the regulation affect the Volunteers would ultimately tend rather to increase than diminish the Volunteer Force My noble Friend the Member for Essex Lord Cecil invite me to explain how it be that our number be still above the number of the come year if we require recruit to keep up our number and only get during the past year The explanation be easy I be speak with reference to the number we shall require hereafter when short service be in full operation and we require the normal number At present a the Report show leave u only below the casualty of the year and a we be effect a considerable reduction in the establishment of a compare with that of we be still some men excess of the reduced Estimate I have be invite to state my view with regard to the supply of horse and I do so in a single sentence If you want horse pay for them A Committee have be appoint on this subject in the other House I hope their inquiry will be interesting and satisfactory and it will give me great pleasure if they can point out a cheap way of obtain horse than that I have mention But a I be ask for my opinion I give it for what it be worth the cheap mode of get horse be to have nothing to do with them when you do not want them and when you do want them to go into the market and buy them as cheaply a you can My Friend the Member for A Brown urge me not to waste money upon the military defence of the colony But my Friend be preach to the convert The essence of the retrenchment we have be able to make be that we have resort to the policy of concentration and have give up the mischievous and lose system of dispersion of force not because we have give up any duty we owe to the colony or be less careful to discharge our duty to our colony but because we desire to have at the least cost to the country the great amount of power with which to discharge all our duty whatever they may be My Friend the Member for Hackney make a he always do an able speech but it contain some curious calculation First he point out the way in which expenditure have increase and show that the present Estimates be the most costly ever submit to Parliament and he support that view by take the gross amount and divide it by the number of men in order to show that the cost per man be great than it have ever be before I think this a very odd criticism from an Gentleman who be recommend u to take men out of the Army and put them into the Reserve because with few men the result would be to leave each remain man still more costly than before The system of which my Friend be so zealous an advocate of maintain numerous cadre to be fill from Reserves be upon this singular mode of calculation not the most economical but the most expensive of system Again if you be all call upon to spend a great deal of money in any one year upon naval arsenal upon arm for the Navy or for any other object not directly connect with the Army and in the same year resolve to economize upon the Army and to maintain a small number of men the result of this ingenious mode of calculation must be to make the cost per man seem very great and you might easily prove that the administration of the Army for that year be the most extravagant ever see The next matter be the allegation that desertion have for the two last year be go on at a rate quite disproportionate to former year There be no doubt there have be a great deal of desertion during the last two year more than during the same period previously And why Because you raise men in eight month in and generally after you have raise an unusual number of recruit at an interval of one or two year you have an unusual number of desertion and if you go back to the last analogous period that of the Indian Mutiny and the China War in when recruiting be also take place on a large scale you will find that they also be year of great desertion But my Friend mode of calculation be entirely fallacious a I show at more length in the statement which I make the other evening I have now endeavour to the best of my ability to recollect and reply to the principal question put to me in the course of this debate Sir PERCY HERBERT Furlough I give the only answer the other evening which it be in my power to give on this subject It be certainly our intention to make everyone a gainer by the change propose and to get rid of the practice of accounting for the ration altogether I promise to consider the subject but the right and gallant Gentleman will not expect me to pledge myself COLONEL The length of service in the colony I be authorise by the to state that in his opinion it be not desirable for military reason to limit the period of service in distant colony to so short a period a the Gentleman opposite recommend for India There be no reason to limit the period of service to that in India but it be think that about year may be fix upon a the limit MAJOR The pledge give in regard to the Artillery officer have not be carry out The and gallant Gentleman must not expect me to take him on his own term and I can not admit that I have depart from any pledge I have give I have endeavour to do my best for the Artillery and Engineer officer and I refer to the Adjutant General of the Army the question of the organization of the Artillery His Report have be lay on the Table One of the proposal alter the organization so a to make the number of battery in a brigade equal and the Adjutant General report upon that subject but pending the inquiry which we understand be be make in India about the Artillery serving there we have not think it desirable to make change at present in the general organization of the regiment MAJOR ask whether major in the Artillery be to be place in the same position a in the Line That be a question which the and gallant Gentleman may discuss with the Government of India MAJOR But in England A major in England receives pay and in respect of command pay and the and gallant Gentleman grievance be that it be not all pay in one lump That I pass by for the moment I now come to the Amendment before the House The Member for Cambridge Fowler say that the Estimates be too large and that we have well reduce them by men He say his great object be to put an end to panic and that there have be panic ever since I wish as much a he do to put an end to panic He speak of the number of men in the Army of this country in This be the first time I have ever hear the example of refer to a one that it be desirable to follow He say we ought not to emulate Germany in the number of our force Most assuredly if we have make such an attempt it be a very lame one for we be ask for but men He say we ought to be conscious of our strength and power but if we be to be conscious of our strength it be necessary that strength should exist But be it too much for this great country and under present circumstance for the Government to ask for men of all rank and arm of the service The Member say Let u adhere to the number we consider sufficient in He remind u that we propose those Estimates and say that those be ample number Let me tell him how we propose to meet that argument He take no objection to the increase of Artillery over and I do not believe he would wish to diminish our present strength of Artillery I do not think he would desire to reduce the Cavalry or the small number of our Engineers or the very moderate addition we have make to the department of Control and the Army Hospital Corps I now conic to the Infantry and I tell my Friend I be prepared to stand by the number of not the number in the aggregate because there have be an increase in the Cavalry the Artillery and in the others of which I have just speak but to the number of the Infantry In the British establishment of Infantry be and there be in men That be a small increase But then I have to set off the West India diminution the reduction in the colonial force and the Madras Force which be in our Estimates and vote by u With these reduction the comparison be slightly in favour of the present year the number be in and in I hope I have now satisfy my Friend that we stand on the ground of with only those exception which experience and necessity require u to adopt which the House and the country go with u in adopt and maintain and which I venture to say the House would desire u still to maintain COLONEL STUART KNOX say that he venture to rise at the same time with the right Gentleman but he suppose the Secretary of State for War wish to shorten the discussion The Baronet the Member for Carlisle Sir Lawson who make a most agreeable speech object to the only part of the plan which he Colonel Stuart Knox could support that of preparation but he must say he do not think that the argument of the Baronet show much consistency He think the Member who once belong to the Hussars Herbert have make a speech which would not have be tolerate in the of his regiment He wish to ask the right Gentleman a question a to the position and status of in the Army There be a feeling among them that they be not properly treat They have be tell that if they go to and remain with their regiment a year they would be appoint lieutenant That promise have not be carry out These gentleman have also be compel to pay for a stamp but they do not hear on what the stamp be to be place He wish to know also whether they be qualify to sit on If these gentleman be to sit on and be not commission officer the prisoner bring before them could not be imprison accord to the law of the land Ho wish to ask whether be commission officer and whether they could legally sit on I believe there be no legal disqualification which prevent from sit on but I fancy that practically there be always a great desire to select officer of sonic age and experience for that important duty I will take this opportunity of state a the and gallant Gentleman have allude to the stamp that at the present time every officer of the Army be require to pay for a stamp upon every new commission he receive but it be now intend to give a gentleman when he become permanently an officer a commission which he may always retain and to exempt him from the necessity of pay for fresh stamp COLONEL STUART KNOX say an ensign up to this time be place during the first six month on every in his regiment and afterwards take his turn of duty and ask whether ho understood rightly that he be not now suppose to be qualify even to learn his duty till after a long time have elapse SIR HENRY STORKS A be a commissioned officer Ho join his regiment and be treat just a an officer always be treat when ho join his regiment for the first time He be send to drill and go a a supernumerary on and when he be consider by his command officer to be fit to sit a a member he do so At the end of month if he be report on in favourable term he go for a year to On his return to his regiment he get the commission of lieutenant and the date of the commission depend upon how he have conduct himself during his first year and during his second year at COLONEL say he wish to call attention to the item a to the sale of horse He point out that the purchase of horse be put down last year at while this year the sum have increase to but the sale of horse last year have produce and this year only He could not understand these figure see that horse have increase in value from to per cent say it be desirable that a gymnastic instructor should be send round to various school to teach gymnastic exercise in order to prepare young men for the Army SIR HENRY STORKS state in reply to Colonel that after the Autumn Manoeuvres all the horse which have be specially purchase except a few which be select to fill up casualty in the Army Service Corps be sell by auction and bring an average price of each SIR PERCY HERBERT call attention to the driver and gunner of Artillery Ho ask the Secretary of State for War to reconsider his determination with regard to them and not get get rid of good men who be trained soldier COLONEL STUART KNOX ask on what principle the pay and allowance of colonel of depot centre have be settle Many of them have hold high position and pay than they would get under the present arrangement reply be not hear COLONEL ask the Secretary of State for War to take into consideration the altered position of the Militia surgeon and also the Militia Staff sergeant who would be affect by the recent change that have take place He also call attention to the position of the quartermaster SIR JOHN call attention to the complaint of the officer command Militia regiment with respect to their transference to the Line say that arrangement with regard to Staff sergeant and quartermaster must grow with the new system that the transfer of officer from the Militia to the Line must depend upon the number of vacancy but it be estimate that from to commission would be give this year and that he be not prepared to commit himself to an increase in the number of subaltern officer in Militia regiment be under the impression that the Government be now act in a liberal spirit and make a transition with as much fairness a possible The appointment to commission in the Line from the Militia would be with the commanding officer but subject to confirmation by the general officer of the district SIR DAVID move to reduce the Vote by be the additional charge for men who may engage to serve in the Militia Reserve Force This money be pay a a sort of extra bounty for about men who undertake no special service and receive no extra train Their present position be that in case of special emergency such a invasion they be liable for service at home or abroad in connection with the Regular Army but in the meanwhile no additional strength be acquire to the Army by the payment of this He express his belief that so long a they maintain the Militia a a sort of competitor for recruit with the Army they would fail to have an amalgamation of the various element of their complicated system of defence and that the Militia Reserve a now constitute tend to keep up that rivalry between the two branch of the service He could not help think that the Secretary of State for War intend when the First Class Reserve be complete to dispense with the service of the Militia and that in do so ho would act wisely But in the meantime they might save that without injure the efficiency of the Militia He beg therefore to move the reduction of the Vote by that sum SIR PERCY HERBERT wish before the right Gentleman rise to ask a question respect the medical examination of men admit into the Reserve He have be inform by a Militia officer that the examination be hold for some time but that afterwards order be give for admission into the Reserve without it that the only way of accounting for this alteration be an anxiety to swell the list and that in consequence men have be admit who prove to be physically unfit for the service Would the right Gentleman state whether that have happen or not and the cause of it say that during the first or second year of his hold Office he find great unwillingness on the part of the men to undergo a second examination and also that there be no real necessity for a second examination With regard to the Motion of the Member for Ayrshire Sir David he have be himself exceedingly sceptical about the Militia Reserve but upon examination and after consult those who be most qualified to give an opinion he have come to the conclusion that it would be desirable to maintain this Reserve General he might add be also strongly in favour of maintain this Force He therefore think it would be unwise to refuse that which give them so very valuable a body of men EGERTON call attention to the circumstance that some of the regiment have to pay for their own range and add that or would meet all the expense which it would be necessary to incur on that score Some of the regiment have also to hire their own exercise ground Most of them be allow to assemble in some nobleman or gentleman park but where that be not the case they have to engage a field for their exercise BARNETT point out that the staff sergeant of the Yeomanry Cavalry only receive on which they be suppose to maintain themselves in a respectable position A BROWN ask whether it be the fact that a Committee be sit upon Volunteer clothing reply that no step have be take that would interfere with the Volunteer uniform If Volunteer battalion desire that their uniform should be assimilate to that of the Regular troop with whom they be brigade their desire would be favourably entertain COLONEL think it would be a great advantage if the sergeant instructor be allow to engage in recruit for the Militia say the sergeant instructor and recruit would both be under the command of the colonel WHEELHOUSE suggest that adjutant attach to Volunteer corp should receive a pension after a certain number of year service think that Volunteer officer should not be put to any expense out of their own pocket in acquire the knowledge now require from them agree that the Volunteers who give their service gratuitously ought not to be call upon to pay any expense out of their own pocket and it be for that reason that the recent increase in the Capitation Grant be make MAJOR say that consider that to be one of the most if not the most important Vote in the whole of the Army Estimates he wish to make it the subject of a few remark They should be brief a he fear to do more would be a mere waste of time a the right Gentleman at the head of the War Office do not appear inclined to make any alteration in the department about which so many complaint be make nor do he seem dispose to allow the country to know what be it precise working He Major felt it his duty to protest on this and every other occasion against thing be allow to remain in their present unsatisfactory condition Two year ago he give Notice of a Resolution on the subject At that time preparation be in progress for the Autumn Manoeuvres of and he determine not to move in the matter at the time a he wish to give the Department the fair possible trial and that determination have meet with general approval the principal organ of the Press admitting that he have hit upon a branch of the military service which be a weak point in that service for which the Government be responsible Indeed The Times newspaper in an article deal with military question at the close of the Session express it approval of the course he take add that the postponement of his Motion would afford reasonable time for the mature deliberation of the Government and at the same time enable the subject to be thoroughly discussed How have that be fulfil The Government might have maturely consider the question but they have make no change and there certainly have be no discussion on the subject Last year when he make a Motion for inquiry and notwithstanding the difficulty which be in his way owe to the late period at which he be enable to come on he be tell by seine of his Friends who hear him that he have make out an unanswerable case but however that might be it certainly have not be answer The right Gentleman the Surveyor General of the Ordnance make some observation to the effect that the Control department be form on the recommendation of Lord Committee In reply he would only say that he have Lord personal assurance that his reason for object so much to the Control department be because it violate what he consider vital principle lay down by the Committee over which he preside Then the right Gentleman support the principle of interchangeability among subordinate in fact he openly and avowedly advocate the theory that one day a Control officer might have charge of bread and beef at another time of complicated military store and at another time have under him men and horse and be administer military law and discipline If that principle be act on we need hardly seek far for a sufficient cause of total inefficiency The right Gentleman also say that General Officers have report favourably of the system Now he have never yet find a general officer who praise the Control department a it at present existed and he do not know that he have ever hear one defend it After a debate on this subject also in another place He do not think the right Gentleman could fall back upon the report of General Officers for the defence of the department for the Government have refuse to produce the report of the General Officers respect it at the Manoeuvres on the ground that they would produce bad blood The illustrious Duke who make that statement add that not a word could be say against individual and he Major be ready to endorse that statement because from all quarter it appear that the Control officer have work with the great zeal and energy What then could have be the tenor of their report except a condemnation of the system There be two point on which he wish to say a few word because they involve great question of principle Those point be the absence of any reserve of any system for the expansion of the Control department especially the transport and the of any system of utilize local resource To prove the first point he need only refer to the Returns which have be recently which show that after have bring in detachment from every part of England and Ireland and after call on the Artillery to perform the duty which ordinarily devolve upon the Control at Dublin and all the principal garrison they be able to place in the field only Control horse and Control driver whilst the combatant branch furnished horse for transport purpose and driver Besides those there be hired horse and hire driver and horse be buy and subsequently sell That show that after several month preparation the transport service be equal to move only about of the Army place in the field for the campaign or in other word a force of something like men and even then it must be remember too that not more than the duty which would devolve upon the department during war have to be perform during the Manoeuvres The supply of the munition of war do not enter into the question at all and a regard the supply of food even to the Army the strain upon the department be not very great Much of the work that would devolve on this department in war be perform by contractor while the regiment be to a large extent supply with food by mean of the canteen and most of the officer provide themselves privately These fact lead him to believe that these Manoeuvres if they be intend to be a rehearsal of what would be do in time of war or to test the capability of the transport department show that that department fell very far short of the mark and that the expenditure be almost an unnecessary one It be absurd to suppose that in time of war we could break up the artillery depot the only mean miserable a it be of expand our field artillery we possess nor could we take men and horse from our attenuated regiment and battalion for that purpose The system now pursue be merely rob Peter to pay Paul It be a policy of which General have denounce before the War and which probably account for much of the disorganization then exist in the French Army Then a to the question of the utilization of local resource he be of opinion that in a sound system of transport and supply the resource of every district of the country a regard food and the mean of transport should be so and organize that they could be utilize at the short notice That be not the case at the Autumn Manoeuvres With regard to the contract for rice flour bran hay and other article the price to him be unaccountable when compare with the current price in the metropolis and many of the principal town throughout the country The Member here quote from a recent Parliamentary Return It would be interest to know on what principle and by whom these contract be make There be one other matter upon which he want some explanation Not long ago a battery of artillery quarter at Sheffield and have gun be to be supply with equipment and receive order to march to The Control department be communicate with and arrangement be enter into for the transport of the gun Notwithstanding that the battery have to pass near the gun be send down and the bring back and the battery horse many of them have to draw the far heavier equipment the whole way from Sheffield to It might be say that this be owe to some mistake of an individual but it show that there be something faulty and wrong in the system The first step to it improvement would be to institute an impartial inquiry into the exist state of thing and he warn the right Gentleman the Secretary for War and the Surveyor General that if a be sometimes say the existence of the present Government be coeval with the existence of the Parliament they would not find it pleasant sit in Opposition to see all the fault and imperfection which if they be not now endeavour to screen they be at least wilfully shut their eye to ruthlessly and mercilessly expose by a search inquiry WHITWELL say that so far a his observation go he be bind to say that the Control department be progress in the right direction Last year he call attention to certain defect which in his opinion exist in the department and it be only right to say that during a able encampment of Militia which have since take place in his own county those defect entirely disappear and the labour and operation of the department be attend with the utmost success Moreover have the and gallant Officer see what be do on Saturday last at he would have have no cause of complaint For his own part he believe there be no department in the Army whose service be more entitled to praise than the Control and the system of transport now establish say he have take some interest in that subject and move for certain Returns to show how the system work but they have never be furnish They must all know that although the movement of troop be direct from the Horse Guards or some high military authority the carry out of the system lay with those whose efficiency be often of a very questionable character In this case the Horse Guards and not the Control department be responsible LORD CECIL say they have have plenty of Reports from general officer but they have never yet have a Report from an officer in command of a marching regiment Now he have receive a letter from an officer of a marching regiment in the late Manoeuvres in which the writer state that the Control have break down more than once that the meat become tainted and that the hired transport break down upon the march He also describe the system a impose too much work on the men more than they be able to perform with justice to themselves or the service and they be often compel to remain without their dinner until or at night and then dine on the bad possible fare LORD believe with his noble Friend the Member for West Essex Lord Cecil that more duty be impose on the men in the Control department than they could perform and that be a practice which he trust his right Friend would put an end to as soon a possible That be the cause of the disaster which befall the French Army in the War Moreover a our Control system do not rest upon the precedent of France or Russia nor upon the recommendation of Lord he regard it a tentative and experimental The Report of His Royal Highness the Field Marshal upon the Autumn Manoeuvres show an improvement this year over last but it be say that the Report publish be not that which His Royal Highness first write but an amended Report and it be also say that Reports of the Generals in command be not favourable to the Control Department show it serious shortcoming The production of those Reports have be refuse Parliament should insist upon see these Reports a upon the proper working of this important department the House ought to be supply with every information as soon a possible and the best time to furnish it be not during a war but in time of peace SIR HENRY STORKS say he would touch on one or two point which have be refer to in the course of the discussion His and gallant Friend have talk of the number of Control officer at the Autumn Manoeuvres but he should recollect that we have those Manoeuvres for the purpose of instruction and of give officer an opportunity of see what practice in the field be Then a to horse He Sir Henry Storks have say the other night that cavalry be a mere question of expense If the House wish to vote a largo number of horse and men a a military man he might be glad to see it but that in his opinion would be a great mistake and what we should aim at be have such a nucleus of a force of instructed men a would be capable of easy expansion As to local resource there be the most accurate knowledge on the part of the department They know everything connect with the railway and their plant and he do not hesitate to say that if it be require to send a force from one end of England to the other it could be do at the short notice Moreover in a great emergency power have be give by Parliament to take the railway and employ them in the service of the State As to the supply of food during the Autumn Manoeuvres look at the weather the distance and the difficulty he think the service be on the whole admirably conduct His noble Friend the Member for West Essex Lord Cecil read a letter from a regimental officer complain that the men have be keep for a long time without their dinner and that the meat arrive late But he would ask his noble Friend who know something about those thing whether he think it right to come down to the House and read the letter merely of an individual officer in a regiment bring such a charge against a department With regard to contract there be a variation in price no doubt and such a variation there must be and anyone who read the heading would find that price vary accord to the place of delivery If a contractor have to deliver hay flour or other thing at different place he would require a high or low price accord to the distance He believe however the contract be make with the great regard to economy after the full examination and with the utmost desire to do justice to the country With respect to the constitution of the Control department the object be to consolidate antagonistic department and to define duty and to fix responsibility No matter how many officer you might have employ you must still have a superior officer in the field to whom all store must be address for without that you could have no security He could assure his and gallant Friend that there be no one who appreciate his remark well than he do or who be more willing to give them due weight than he be COLONEL say he concur in the remark of his and gallant Friend the Member for the City of Hereford Major that the Vote be a very important one for have regard to an army in the field there be no doubt the Control department deserve the most serious consideration He be not one of those who would ask that the confidential Reports of general officer should be lay on the Table of the House but when his right Friend opposite the Surveyor General of Ordnance find fault with his noble Friend the Member for West Essex Lord Cecil for reach the letter of an individual officer and shelter himself behind the Reports of general officer he would ask that if the substance of these Reports should not be lay on the Table it should at least be state by his right Friend Nothing would give more confidence or more satisfaction to the public than that the right Gentleman should get up and state that if the Reports of the general officer be confidential those officer be of opinion that the Control department be as satisfactory a we have a right to expect or a they wish It must be remember that we could not make requisition in this country a could be do in The system would not be tolerate here for one moment The two thing be not to be mention in the same day Therefore we must on that account make great allowance for the Control department If the Reports of the general officer be favourable he hop the right Gentleman would get up and say so say he must put it to the Committee whether what be now ask of him be not most extraordinary Either a document ought to be produce or it ought not If a document ought not to be produce nothing should be say of it His Royal Highness after full consideration on a review of all the Autumn Manoeuvres have place the result of those Papers before the House in the form which he have decide LORD CECIL say he have certainly not give the name of the officer whose letter he have mention for it also be a confidential communication but he should be happy with his permission to give his name when the right Gentleman produce the Reports of the general officer LORD say he object to the title of Controller a an one He would have call the controller purveyor and think they should be place under the officer in command Whatever might be think of the department however he could not allow the opportunity to pass without offer one word of praise to his right Friend the Surveyor General of Ordnance Every one who have the pleasure of see that most magnificent review on Common on Saturday must agree that the service of the Control department be most efficient and satisfactory in furnish those excellent which make admirable stand and he venture to suggest that if they be hand over to the right Gentleman the First Commissioner of Works they would be find very useful on occasion of public meeting in the Parks SALT think it most important that the troop and especially the Militia and the Volunteers should not be expose to great hardship or inconvenience in the way of supply than be absolutely unavoidable In fact he believe that such a course would do much to stop recruiting There might be difficulty in furnish supply but they must be overcome That be a subject on which a civilian have a right to speak He do not blame any one and speak a a complete outsider but it appear to him that a soldier march a whole day should have supply to him or carry with him at least one good meal SIR HENRY STORKS say that extra provision have be make for the supply of the troop during the Autumn Manoeuvres each man be furnish with a bread and cheese ration If the Member would refer to the contract he would find that there be a considerable contract for cheese at per cwt It be an extra ration to be supply between the early morning meal and the usual midday bread and meat ration SALT understood that in some case money be furnish to the troop instead of bread It be almost impossible to get bread and when they do get it the money serve out would not buy enough in consequence of the exorbitant price charge LORD HENRY mention the case of some troop who have march very early in the morning and do not get to camp till when the only food serve out be a piece of junk and the horse receive no fodder at all till next morning During the whole of the Manoeuvres the food supply be very coarse more especially the cheese and give great dissatisfaction to every one point out that while in all other case officer of the same relative rank receive the same relative allowance chaplain of the Forces do not receive the same allowance a other officer with whom they rank SIR HENRY STORKS say that the matter be now under consideration ask whether attention have be direct to the excess of expenditure for transport occasion by railway company charge soldier more than other passenger He be tell that a soldier on furlough be charge for travel from Manchester to Dublin while any other person could travel the same distance for SIR HENRY STORKS say the department have be in communication with the railway company on the subject of transport and he be sorry to say that no satisfactory result have be arrive at On certain occasion deduction be allow a they would be by the South Western Company on account of soldier go to Windsor on Tuesday The department avoid as much a possible send soldier by railway Marching when that be practicable be good for the men if only the difficulty of could be overcome In one instance an exchange of troop at Dublin have be effect by employ one of Her Majesty and the saving on the whole transaction be COLONEL NORTH also draw attention to the allegation just make that even a soldier on furlough be charge in excess of the ordinary fare say that a soldier on furlough ought to travel on the same term a a private individual and if he be not allow to do so it could only be hop that the new regulation which the House be pass would remedy the grievance WHITWELL complain of the insufficiency of the allowance of to Volunteers for attend battalion drill He hop that some good arrangement than those that exist at present would be make for the purpose of bring Volunteers to the military centre say that the allowance have be increase some time ago to and he believe on the average it be sufficient MAJOR urge a complaint a to the withdrawal of forage allowance from Artillery field officer Calling attention to the fact that many officer who have be receipt of forage allowance for year in one case as much a year on account of rank confer on them for service in the field be now deprive of it on be make substantive major He do not believe so glare an injustice could have be bring under the Secretary of State own eye SIR HENRY STORKS say that the allowance which have be withdraw be an irregularity which have escape detection for a length of time The complaint should however receive his careful attention WHARTON say the allowance to permanent Staff sergeant of Militia in lieu of food fuel and clothing be fix some year ago when food and fuel be much cheap than they be now and the consequence be that they be very insufficient hop that something would be do to remedy the hardship of person who have soldier billet upon them during the Autumn Manoeuvres because the amount of money pay at present be not sufficient to compensate them SIR HENRY STORKS say that it be propose to give an additional per billet beyond the sum mention in the Mutiny Act and this regulation would apply to the Manoeuvres of last year as well a to those of the present LORD say it be rumour that horse be now be buy that be sell at the close of the last Manoeuvres and that we be of course pay for them the advance in the market price Would it not be possible to save what be lose in sale and repurchase by arrange with the farmer to keep them while they be not want He wish also to ask whether the department could not introduce Australian moat which be come into such general use and which he know from personal experience be as good food a could be put before any one SIR HENRY STORKS say that all the horse purchase by the Government be mark so that they would not be by them As to Australian meat nothing would be more difficult than to make the British soldier eat what he have not be accustom to and until Australian meat come into more general use he should not like to try them in the Army MAJOR say he should like a further explanation of the allege irregularity with regard to the drawing of forage because he have draw it himself many year He have always believe and do so now that he have draw it on the authority of a Royal Warrant If the allowance be to be regulate a suggest by the Surveyor General by the amount of mount duty to be do save might be effect in the case of certain controller who from consideration possibly of personal safety never mount a horse He suggest it would be beneficial to soldier to use salt meat once for the simple reason that a the salt ration would cost less than the fresh the balance might be expend on pea suet or anything else the men prefer He believe if that be do the men would raise no objection but would rather approve the variation of diet While recommend that course for adoption however he would strongly urge that salt meat should only be issue to the troop when live in barrack or stand camp and under no circumstance to those engage in moveable camp a be the case during the Autumn Manoeuvres of and He do that for two reason namely that under the latter circumstance it could not conveniently be subject to the necessary process of be well soak before use and secondly because it issue not require so much foresight and exertion a fresh meat in the matter of supply would still further the very slight test to which the control department have be subject during the late military exercise COLONEL STUART KNOX in pursuance of the Question put by the Member below the gangway wish to know whether some step could not be take to enable the soldier on furlough to travel by railway at the ordinary military rate in the same manner a officer be permit to do say that every effort have be make by the Government to obtain justice for the soldier in this respect but the matter be in the hand of the railway company and not in those of the Government SIR HARRY inquire why tailor in regiment be not employ to make their comrade clothes He be of opinion that a large proportion of the men clothes might be make in the regiment SIR HENRY STORKS reply that it would be altogether impossible to carry out the proposition of the Baronet a regard the Infantry The tailor in regiment make alteration a to the fitting of the clothing and the Cavalry do make their own clothing LORD CECIL think that fatigue clothes should be supply to the men engage in the Autumn Manoeuvres in order to prevent their best clothes from be destroy on those occasion a they be under the present system MAJOR suggest that the surplus of the canteen fund should be apply towards purchase the fatigue clothes refer to by the noble Lord say that any canteen fund surplus ought to go in reduction of the price charge in the canteen and not to the purchase of clothes MAJOR say he have always keep up the price of the beer sell in the canteen in the interest of the health of the men It be difficult to prevent a large canteen surplus from accumulate and equally difficult to know how to spend the surplus allow by regulation LORD draw attention to the untidy and useless legging supply to the soldier they be a perfect scandal to the British Army Neither sportsman nor Volunteers would think of wear such uncomfortable article He hop that legging of some good pattern would be supply to the Army because it be of the utmost importance that the men foot and leg should be comfortable when on the march SIR HENRY STORKS admit that nothing could be more unsightly than the legging and the matter be under consideration In reply to the suggestion of the noble Lord the Member for West Essex Lord Cecil he could not pledge himself to furnish the soldier with fatigue dress but arrangement be in contemplation to allow the soldier to wear their old clothes so that that they might keep their good suit to appear in on parade GREGORY draw attention to a new and cheap system of rifle old ordnance in such a way a to permit projectile to be use It be well know that they have a large stock of those warlike store that might be make available The question be a technical one and he felt some difficulty in speak upon it but look at the high price charge per gun he consider the matter be one deserve the attentive consideration of the Committee Evidence on the subject have be take before the Select Committee on Ordnance which sit in and the tendency of that give by Colonel Captain Scott and other officer go to show that both a regarded efficiency and safety the Britten gun be superior to the Armstrong and the carrying a it do a distance of mile with a mean of The experiment be conduct with the powder hitherto use which be violently explosive and likely to increase the recoil but with the the experiment would probably be still more favourable to the Britten gun Further trial should be make before incur additional expense under the new system and he venture to think that a less sum would answer all practical purpose for the present than the one under consideration The Gentleman conclude by move that the Vote be reduce by the sum of HICK second the Amendment which he think be one of great interest and require the serious attention of the Committee His attention be more particularly attract to the subject by a paper of Britten which have be bring before the Institution of Civil Engineers in April last of which Institution he Hick be a member The author of that paper grapple with the question in a most masterly manner evince a thorough knowledge of the whole subject and use argument in support of his view which he Hick consider unanswerable The broad issue raise be this could they if the knowledge they now possess be rightly apply reduce the present enormous cost of their ordnance without lower the standard of it efficiency so that the country might be good arm and at the same time be relieve of a heavy burden And he think that now when they have instrument which test with accuracy not only the pressure of the powder upon the chamber of a gun but also the velocity of the shot a it leave the muzzle there could not be any difficulty in do so Those instrument have be introduce into America long before we have adopt them and by their use the manufacturer of gun would be able to measure their strength accord to the pressure they would have to bear That must be to ordnance designer just a important an instrument a the analogous be to the engineer who scheme a steam engine that be to say if an engineer have to construct a boiler and know what pressure it would have to bear he could apportion it strength to the pressure but if he be not aware of what the pressure be all he have to do be to make it strong enough not to burst under any pressure In one case he could by adapt mean to end with intelligence construct a scientific instrument in the other he could only make a very clumsy machine needlessly expensive and needlessly strong He might point to the large boiler that could not burst and ask you to admire the great skill with which he have make it so thick so sound and so perfect that nothing could burst it If he do so he would be only call attention to a mere monument of his ignorance and folly Just in the same way if the ordnance engineer know the pressure his gun would have to bear he could make it of sufficient strength but if he do not know the extent of the pressure he have to make his gun strong enough not to burst under any pressure Where a gun be make strong than it be practically require to be it be so much money throw away Britten therefore ask why with the knowledge we have acquire from the use of these instrument we should go on blundering in the dark instead of make weapon properly design accord to that knowledge and represent economy of science Beyond that the new pressure gauge have introduce a partial revolution for it have inform them that the powder they be use be unnecessarily violent and so strong in fact that it rapidly destroy the inside of their gun and render them completely unserviceable after a few round The be that they have now introduce pebble powder largely into the service whereas hitherto they have only use it by way of experiment Pebble powder a most Members be aware consist of large grain from to of an inch square and be much slow in burning than ordinary powder From a table compile from the preliminary report of the Committee on explosive it be find that the maximum pressure upon a gun inch long and with an bore when pebble powder be use be less than when the ordinary powder be use and such powder propel the ball with far great velocity it be in the one case foot per second a against The pebble powder burn slow than the common powder and although at the moment of ignition it pressure be only that of the ordinary powder be a six ton on the square inch to yet it expand with a great volume when the ball advance about six inch in the barrel and the result be that the projectile be discharge with great force than that effect by the more highly explosive powder the maximum pressure of which upon the interior surface of the gun be just double that of the other Britten therefore say and in do so he open up the whole question that if the ordinary powder be to be continue in use there would still be the necessity for construct the gun of great strength than be sufficient to bear it strain but if the pebble powder which be at present only use by way of experiment be to be employ that strength might be reduce and the cost of the gun would be proportionately diminish Although it be the custom to boast of our gun a be infinitely superior to all others because of their strength yet the foreigner simply say that his gun be strong enough for the purpose require and would be no good if make ten time strong a regard material That seem to him Hick so clear that it require a proper answer before the Vote be pass Britten have not only point all that out but have suggest a remedy and have prove that in design ordnance if due attention be pay to the economical employment of all the force set to work instead of make weapon a they now do wholly of very costly material they might with perfect safety rely largely on cast iron which be so much cheap He be aware that the authority at be constantly pester with the scheme of inventor but Britten be one which have stand the test of strict inquiry have be extensively apply in America and the country ought to have an answer about it He would now call attention to one or two suggestive fact a to the waste of money incur in produce gun of an inordinate strength and would quote Britten From those fact which be open to correction it would appear in the case of a gun which have be most severely try at in test sample of powder and which though nominally of calibre carry a lb shot yet in reality be of calibre and carry a shot of the charge be full battering charge of lb of powder of all kind mild as well a violent and yet this gun have endure some or round It must be bear in mind that a an gun it ought to weigh ton and the thickness of it wall should be whereas the fact be that a a gun it wall be only thick Yet that of wrought iron prove amply strong enough to resist a pressure of over to the inch considerably more than fell on the firing service charge where the pressure be only per inch and to stand which the monster gun be build up with wall of no less than of metal Britten therefore fairly ask why should not half of that metal on the outside be of cast iron It be only require to withstand the recoil and be not require for strength in fact it could not give it for the simple reason that a very large proportion of the mass lay far beyond the range of elasticity of any metal whatever For himself he believe that a considerable proportion of our gun and the most expensive part of our large gun namely the outside shell which carry the might be make of Those large gun which he would admit be beautiful specimen of workmanship now cost from to and he think they might be reduce some to per cent in cost without be render a bit less efficient He ask them why the use of have be abolish The objection to it use come from the Report of the late Ordnance Select Committee which he have see and find one clear fact in namely that it admit that the rifle gun which Britten try bore every test and give satisfactory result but that similar gun on the Armstrong shunt system of rifle and some others fire with rigid projectile have all fail but that be from no fault of the material but from the absurd system of rifle adopt Britten plan however of coat the shell with lead effectually prevent the gun from burst But although the Britten gun succeed they be not adopt because the shunt gun fail Yet after that the shunt system be adopt for the service several hundred of gun be so make although it be remarkable that these would not stand and that the plan have ultimately to be give up several have burst explosively while in many the interior be frequently find to split A peculiarity of that system of rifle be contain in the groove which vary at different part of the gun for instance at the point of discharge and up to of the muzzle they be deep admitting of easy passage to the shot but at that distance they culminate in an incline up which it have to travel thereby compress the stud on it surface of an inch In fact the shot be grip tightly and perfectly centre just when it leave the muzzle at the moment of it great velocity Besides that these projection be of face with zinc and when compress at the muzzle of the gun a they be he think that if anyone have wish to destroy them he could not have resort to a more ingenious plan for the purpose He would now allude to one more fact They have still in service many thousand of gun what pressure do they bear when they be fire That have be ascertain a he believe at Britten suggestion a follow The service charge for a gun be a it have always be lb of what be call and it have be find that that cause a pressure of from to ton per square inch while the full battering charge for a rifled gun of the same calibre be lb of the new pebble powder cause a pressure of from only to ton per square inch The gun weigh only ton yet it have to stand more than the gun But that be not all for these gun have be prove with charge of lb of the old violent powder thereby subject them to a strain even more severe than fell on the gun fire the full service charge of the new powder a fact more astounding when it be recollect that the thickness of the be only about against of and steel combine Not per cent of the supply by the best contractor ever fail under that enormous proof Was that evidence of it weakness or uncertainty His experience a he believe be that of all other civil engineer be that when well make and properly handle it be quite as certain a any other iron and that in fact in large mass it be less liable to vary under manipulation than or steel The fact be that if care have be observe and pebble powder employ some of the gun which have be give up might have be use at the present time Although we have lately be sell many of our gun still we have many more in the service and he contend that they might be make fit for a great deal of work by simple rifle which could be do at a trifle cost with the machinery we have at A very important question hinge upon the present Motion It be whether that House be to have the control of these large sum of money or not The House have a right to know why they be spend He have no doubt the money be honestly spend but be it wisely spend No establishment in the world could be manage with great care great precision and great regard to economy than the Arsenal at be During the last five year however we have spend something like upon gun which be now utterly useless and although the Infants be admirable gun he maintain they be needlessly strong and be of opinion they cost more than be really necessary In fact in the last year we have spend on our ordnance and what have we get for the money Had we have value for it If not why not We know from the Report of the Committee that go in Armstrong gun which be now throw aside How much more of what we vote be waste we do not know There have be shunt gun wedge gun gun and now we have what be significantly call the system but what great right have we to say it be correct than when Armstrong gun be be make by thousand It might be suppose that a necessary consequence of these improvement would be that some alteration would have be adopt for reduce the excessive cost of these weapon but the model and pattern settle and seal eight or ten year ago remain the model for and tomorrow and there do not appear any chance of the slight change be entertain The design be fix and right or wrong be to be persevere with Such conduct however be simply absurd for if the country be to hold it power among nation it could only do so by at least keep pace with them in the application of science to the art of war In order to do that invention must be stimulate not depressed and there ought to be a general confidence that anyone who by study or genius be able to suggest an idea which might be work out for the public good would receive from the Government fair consideration In fact the gun of the period for the future must be the high embodiment of the scientific principle on which it success depend They still require an enormous number of rifled gun Scarcely one of their fortification be properly arm with them and in their dependency they have hardly anything save the antiquate Their gun factory have be busy but with their present plan could not furnish what they want nor could they afford to pay for it There be plenty to do in make the monster ordnance need for their ship and coast defence Those be special service weapon and they require comparatively few As to utilize our gun he believe many of them might be use in check the landing of troop and that they might be render very serviceable in our dependency They would be thoroughly effective at a mile if they be only rifle and they might be rifle in their place at a very trifling cost without bring them home In conclusion he might say he scarcely expect the Motion would be carry indeed he hop it would not for he trust that the occasion for it would be remove by the Government give them an assurance that the question should be fairly try and that the money vote for ordnance should not only be honestly but wisely spent MAJOR BEAUMONT though sympathize with the object of the Amendment could not agree with all the argument adduce in it support The question raise be whether the introduction of pebble powder have not render it possible to utilize gun which before be unserviceable Pebble powder resemble a push rather than a blow it be slow in it action than ordinary gunpowder and accumulate it power thereby put less strain on the gun In fact it be just the reverse of dynamite and violent explosive of that kind When the system of Britten be first propose pebble powder be hardly know With all deference to the Member for Bolton Hick his Major Beaumont own opinion be that be decidedly unreliable and practically there be no way of prove the real endurance of gun except by prove each individual gun The Lancaster gun for instance use at the siege of give extremely satisfactory result but such result have never be again obtained One argument bring forward in the course of this debate be that if a gun be strong enough there could be no object in make it this argument be unanswerable but in reality it be impossible to make gun strong enough a a perfect gun ought to be able to go on firing for ever Although his individual opinion be that be not a fit material for the construction of our ordnance yet a many Members of that House along with many member of the Institute of Engineers differ in opinion from him he suggest that the Government should allow some of the gun in stock to be test with pebble powder in order that the question might be set at rest A few gun might be give up to be experiment upon and the Government need not commit themselves any far He trust such a trial would not be deem unworthy of consideration by Her Majesty Government for although the gun we now have be second to none in Europe and the opportunity which he have have of see what be be do abroad have confirm him in that opinion yet he still think they should not in any way relax their exertion to keep the advantage they now possess GENERAL SIR GEORGE BALFOUR say that he have hear the speech of the Member for East Sussex in favour of Britten claim with great interest for he well remember the meritorious effort of Britten to introduce rifled ordnance indeed that gentleman be one of the early advocate of rifle and his system have be try in India He therefore deserve well of the country and if any reward could be give Britten for his labour he Sir George Balfour would be glad to see that reward bestow Nevertheless he listen with apprehension to the open up of the whole question of rifle old gun make of cast iron He do not desire a renewal of such experiment a have be make during the last year for if they look back over them they would find their cost could be count by million of money No doubt the scientific knowledge of the Member for Bolton have be ably apply in support of the Motion of the Member for East Sussex but this advocacy depend on the accuracy of calculation a to the strain on gun by the use of pebble powder and on the endurance of in sustain the strain throughout a long fire The experiment recommend by the last speaker might perhaps be concede but he should look upon it with reluctance because he fear it would derange the exist system and prevent that uniformity in regard to gun which it be so desirable to have in the service At present the nature of rifled ordnance be but few in number whereas the system advocate would introduce many nature for the conversion of all our gun would be effect thereby introduce not only many calibre but an innumerable number of different kind of projectile than which nothing could be more objectionable He regard the introduction of ordnance into the service a an extremely doubtful experiment and if such gun be adopt they should be place in a very subordinate position for under any view these convert gun be piece This he could confidently state that the service be very unwilling to receive them The result of the high class of gun only be introduce would give the great satisfaction to all branch of the service and it be neither wisdom nor economy to rely upon any other but the best description of ordnance SIR HENRY STORKS say there could be no doubt whatever of the great importance of the question introduce by his Friend the Member for East Sussex Gregory The invention or plan of Britten have be long and often before the War Department The system have be carefully examine by eminent person and every desire exist to give effect to the system if it be possible to do so His Friend have rely upon the Report of the Ordnance Committee of which be no doubt in favour of Britten system a compare with eight other system but the Report go on to say that the question remain to be answer whether any of the plan be suitable for adoption The Committee besides avow considerable mistrust of gun unless the restriction adopt a to charge with respect to howitzer be observe in fire them While the Committee be consider those various plan another plan be submit by Major and he hold in his hand detail Reports of experiment make with the gun and the Britten gun which he would be ready to lay on the Table of the House if they be move for They have in fact very little confidence in gun The untrustworthiness of the material be show by the fact that after full trial in America it be give up gun be fairly test in the States but it appear from the Report make in by a Committee on Ordnance which sit at Washington that no more rifled gun should be mount on fortification or on until such improvement be make in them as would render them reliable for that so far they be unworthy of confidence The treacherous character of a testify by the Reports from America be bear out by our own experience in this country for at out of mortar have burst and a great many others both of the and the be pronounce unserviceable The tendency of these Reports go to prove that in most case gun have burst when subject to anything like a severe trial and it be determine in consequence by the War Department that they should be give up They be prepare at the same time to give the suggestion of Britten the most serious consideration although on the whole it be impossible the War Department could embark in a series of experiment which be sure to be expensive and probably useless unless a very strong necessity compel them to do so They have now get a gun which he believe to be the best in the world and which have the confidence both of the Army and of the Navy and that be so he do not think it be desirable in the interest either of economy or efficiency to take the course which have be propose LORD say he be at one time favourable to the introduction of the American gun but the experiment which have take place show that it be anything but efficient He object to hand over or gun to Britten to be experiment on although the suggestion be he admit very take The only result would be to unsettle the whole question and to throw difficulty and doubt in the way of the Government and he for one would not he confess after the evidence which have be just refer to by his right and gallant Friend the Surveyor General of Ordnance show that in the American War great loss of life have be occasion by the bursting of gun have the moral courage to put gun into the hand of our Artillery Let him take the case of With the improved powder the pressure could be so reduced a to produce without any great pressure on any part a very great initial velocity but would any Member like to use a sport gun instead of the ordinary gun make in coil He believe not yet that be what the Secretary for War be now ask to do in the case of big gun The question of be also very important It be the fashion to say that big gun should not be but France and use gun and a gun be in these day an anachronism In a mechanical country like that a good ought not to be regard a hopeless and if the Government would offer a good prize a be do in regard to a he believe that a good heavy gun would be forthcoming He should like to know the number of gun at present make and what trial or test a to endurance they have undergone SIR HENRY STORKS say the War Office regard the system to be inferior for heavy gun in point of power in point of simplicity and in point of rapidity of load In each of those respect the gun be superior to the The system weaken a gun precisely at that point where it ought to be strengthen The plan have be adopt at all event partially by most of the nation of Europe and of the East The present Russian gun be an one throwing lb we have a gun throw and one throw a projectile of lb The Navy have be supply with all the gun it require to the number of and with regard to the land gun in number it be intend to lengthen them three foot which would add another ton to their weight and they would in future be describe as gun As to the exposure to which the men be subject who have to load the gun a most ingenious be invent by Sir William Armstrong By that plan the gun be run back the muzzle depress and the gun sponge out and load by a hydraulic machine That be now under consideration If this invention appear to be worthy of adoption it would get rid of the difficulty of which question the War Office be disincline to Speaking generally the authority consider that we have the very best gun in the world and to the question would lead to experiment of a very costly character which be not consider necessary MAJOR BEAUMONT say that the opinion of artillery officer would be unanimous a to the desirability of have for heavy gun provide mechanical men could produce one which would burn a sufficient quantity of powder to give the requisite initial velocity to the projectile COLONEL What be the cost of one of these gun SIR HENRY STORKS Each cost say million of money have be waste in the manufacture of gun which have turn out useless The Committee therefore must not accept the dictum of the Ordnance authority and he be not satisfied that Britten plan for utilize our old cast iron gun have receive proper attention What be ask be that the Government should allow such a series of experiment a would satisfy the public that the plan for test these gun and for effect thereby a great economy have be fairly try with the new powder and under new condition previously unknown say if it could be show that these gun could be safely use the War Office would be the first to adopt any safe method of use them but he could hold out no hope that the War Office would allow the use of gun because some of them might be use without burst in defiance of all the experiment make here and in foreign country show that gun could not be use safely COLONEL wish to ask before the Vote be put whether the machinery at Enfield have be convert for the manufacture of rifle whether those rifle be be issue to the troop and if so what number have be order whether the adopt if adopt at all be the long or short rifle and whether the bayonet to be use with it be the bayonet or the modern sword bayonet LORD say he have hear many unfavourable report of the rifle and even general have tell him that it be a thoroughly unsatisfactory weapon that the troop do not like it that it recoil so much that they be afraid to use it that the failed that there be no similarity in the pull between different rifle in fact that the nation after long inquiry and a large expenditure have get a gun which have prove a failure and with which it would be unwise to persevere He have go into the Committee which sit upon the subject a an opponent of the rifle but he be bind to say that he leave that Committee a a convert to it As to the recoil he have test the rifle with Ross fire it slowly and fire it quickly and they do not feel the recoil in the least It have also be test by several men belong to the Rifle Brigade who happen to be on guard at the Arsenal at and they agree that the recoil be less than that of the first pattern which be heavy and even less than the Snider which they be in the habit of use He hop his right Friend the Surveyor General of Ordnance would be able to assure them that the report to which he have refer be unfounded SIR HENRY STORKS say that with reference to the question of his and gallant Friend opposite the Member for West Sussex Colonel he have to state that during the year end March last rifle have be turn out at Enfield The department at Enfield be now capable of produce rifle at ordinary hour of labour and step be be take to increase the power of the factory so that could be produce in a week They be substitute to a great extent machinery for hand labour and that would be the mean of lead to great rapidity and accuracy of production During the year they propose to make rifle at Enfield and by private manufacturer He be happy to say that he could give the most favourable report regard the weapon Much have be say of the recoil of this rifle but he hold in his hand a large number of report from officer and the great majority of them state that the recoil be not excessive There be complaint when the weapon be first issue of but the report state that the main spring have be strengthen and that have now practically cease The Committee which have be appoint to investigate this subject report that in their opinion the be superior in range and precision to the Snider and to the They have not a yet receive any specimen of the new Imperial German rifle The report of the commanding officer of regiment also speak most highly of the rifle He have write to Earl on the subject of the arm and his Lordship state that the rifleman who have use it in shoot for the last stage of the Queen Prize have express a strong feeling of approval of the and a hope that it might soon become the weapon of the Volunteer Force COLONEL complain of the neglected state of the barrack at Glasgow say that be one of the property which have fall into Chancery have become an eyesore The contractor fail to do his duty and that lead to suit in Chancery The litigation however have now come to an end and arrangement be be make for a new contract It be propose to place a squadron of cavalry at Glasgow WHEELHOUSE want to know what measure be be take for the improvement of the barrack at Leeds MAJOR urge upon the Government the desirability of furnish barrack room for officer COLONEL NORTH ask why should not officer in the Army be place in a similar position to officer in the Navy with regard to the furnishing of their room the Government to provide the furniture and the officer to pay a percentage for it use About the close of the Crimean War he call attention to this subject and the right Gentleman the Secretary of State for War at the time highly approve his proposal and so do the and yet after the lapse of so many year nothing have be do SIR HENRY STORKS say the subject have be under consideration but there be find to be great in the way Officers embark on board ship for three year take the furniture that be provide for them and pay a percentage But in the case of a regiment of the Line it might get the route and have to march and then it would be necessary to have damage assess which of course should be do at the expense of the officer and would give rise to great difficulty COLONEL NORTH could not see the slight difficulty in the matter When soldier be leave damage be charge to them why could not the same be do in the case of officer who be use to be charge and charge exorbitantly LORD CECIL say that at present the Government supply a table and two chair why not go a little further and let the officer have a bedstead chest of drawer and a few other article It would be a great saving to the officer and no great expense to the country He be glad to find from the Vote that the few remark which he have make last year in reference to work at Bermuda have be productive of a certain amount of good result It seem that black labour which be very costly have be do away with that a permanent fort have be abolish and some of the contractor charge have be considerably reduce He hop what have be do there would be do in other outlying station and that without go to large expense for permanent work which would be unnecessary we should have economy and efficiency at the same time WHITWELL suggest a good classification of the various detail of the Vote and remark that the charge for architect and superintendence be something like per cent which be a very large sum LORD say that there be some fine old tree at Portsmouth which in the progress of the work there he find to his horror it be intend to cut down in order to get some ground for build store of some kind He venture to enter a protest against the proceeding step have be take in consequence and the tree have be spar Engineers should take counsel so that the appearance of a place should be consult a little as well a the gaining of ground He saw no mention in the Vote of any repair go on at the line He should like to know what sum have be expend in repair that fortification SIR HARRY suggest that the Government should consider the question of supply officer with moss plate subject to their pay interest on the outlay in reply to the Members for Oxfordshire and Buckingham Colonel North and Sir Harry say that he would be delight to furnish all the barrack of the country not only with plate but furniture but it would involve a very large outlay and the length of time which the and gallant Gentleman the Member for Oxfordshire have be labour in the cause show that other Governments besides the present have felt the difficulty in the way He be aware that the state of the cavalry barrack at Leeds be not satisfactory but at present there be no money ask for repair them CAPTAIN call attention to the state of new state that while the old College be the present one cost the country a large sun of money and be not view by the student with the same affection and respect for the cadet of old look back to it with something like the feeling of pride and veneration with which and Harrow be regard by those who have have the privilege of be educate there But the system pursue at new be very different Under the present system young officer after pass through the inhuman and unjust ordeal of a competitive examination or have take an University degree join their regiment for a year and be then send back to at the age of or they be then place under school discipline and expose to a system of irritate espionage place under arrest for the most frivolous cause keep in their room and punish for several day He believe too that system have be carry out illegally Instead of continuous instruction the year be break up by their vacation On Friday and Saturday there be no study after and a there be no society in the neighbourhood unless the officer be of a very studious turn they could only amuse themselves by drink brandy and water on Friday Saturday and Sunday He have put a Motion on the Paper to call attention to the scandal but in deference to the wish of the parent of the young officer who have do nothing he be assure unbecoming the character of gentleman he do not press it on the notice of the House Owing to the system which be carry on the College be in a state bordering on mutiny disgust and discontent prevail among the officer who hat it most cordially He do not think that under these circumstance the disestablishment of could be accompany with the slight inconvenience and therefore he have no hesitation in move that the vote be reduce by the sum of the sum requisite for it maintenance LORD CECIL observe that two month ago a Question be ask on this subject to which his right Friend the Secretary of State for War give a very meagre response His object now be to ascertain a little more of the truth of the story than his right Friend have then vouchsafe to give so that the Committee might see who be in fault He have not be able to make very minute inquiry into the scandal but there be no doubt a very serious spirit of insubordination among a certain number of young officer As he understand the answer of his right Friend it seem to throw a little more blame on those officer than they deserve He however do not stand up to defend their conduct he think it insubordinate to say the least of it He think it bad taste and it might be something worse He believe his old friend Sir Duncan Cameron have do everything in his power but he be not sure that the same judiciousness in the mode of deal with the young men have be show by other authority on the occasion As far a he could find out the history of the scandal at be very much the same a that which occur at some year ago There have be a system of petty vexatious annoyance treat student officer like schoolboy That system be very much to be deplore for it tend to make young men break out and commit schoolboy act which in their cooler moment they be sorry for These young men of and it seem be not allow to have and brandy when they ask for it at breakfast The cadet after have previously enjoy the liberty of the regimental mess be subject to certain law a to what they should eat drink and avoid which it be probable that even boys at would have rebel against Certainly it be too much to subject young men who have attend a regimental mess for some month to this new Spartan discipline Some year ago when he call attention to the grave fault of the system a Royal Commission be appoint and it devise a scheme of After an interregnum some one in the War Office devise this new scheme which be found on the German model but the difference between the German and the English system be that in Germany a young man serve a a soldier in a regiment and in England he join a regiment a an officer and be admit to all the advantage of the mess Of course he would feel much more be send back to school again than a young man who have undergone discipline in the rank That have be very much felt by officer who have be send to they have complain very much of the system of treatment there and they have rebel against it He say that much in order to induce the right Gentleman the Secretary of State for War to state what he know in order that they might judge who be to blame whether the young men or the system At the same time he trust that after the explanation of the right Gentleman the reduction of the Vote would not be persist in He wish to ask how far the recommendation of the Commission have be carry out at also cause it be unwise on general ground to allow the labour of any Commission to be throw away say there be few Commissions that have have more of their suggestion carry out than that on Military Education but Commissioners seldom look at the cost their recommendation would involve in the way the Government be bind to look at it A good deal of money however have be spend usefully in pursuance of the recommendation of the Commission There have be establish a system of garrison instruction which be serve extremely well Great improvement have be make in the system of educate private in the Army and the last Report of the Director of Military Education contain a surprising account of those improvement In compliance with the recommendation of the Commission building have also be erect at and and no Member of the Commission therefore need be sorry for the labour he have bestow upon it The Government have not incur all the expenditure that be recommend at because in their other claim have precedence The noble Lord the Member for West Essex Lord Cecil could hardly expect him to give a recital of what have occur at it be the last thing he should like to do It be fortunate the Vote do not come on two month ago because nothing could be more agreeable than what have occur during those two month and everything be now go on satisfactorily The and gallant Gentleman opposite Captain have speak of the inhuman ordeal of a competitive examination but there be no ordeal at which be more inhuman than all be subject to or than he be subject to in that House Of course it be impossible to encourage the drinking of brandy and in a morning before breakfast but have hear from that able intelligent and excellent officer Sir Duncan Cameron what be actually do at he must say that he find the discipline at Oxford with all the liberty they have much more strict than at Indeed Sir Duncan Cameron assure him that these young gentleman be treat exactly a they would be if they be with their What be intend and what he believe be value be that these officer should have the opportunity of gain that sort of education that be gain by officer in Germany and he know that the distinguish foreign officer who be here in express great approbation of the training which be give at After these explanation he trust the Amendment would be withdraw SIR HARRY approve of the removal of the Duke of York Schools into the country where the boy might be employ in agriculture with great benefit to their health WHITWELL say he do not intend to support the Motion of the and gallant Member opposite Captain for reduce the amount of the Vote by the sum appropriate to the support of College because he think it be most important that the education of our officer should be secure but at the same time he felt that it be scarcely right that while be spend in the government of the College for and the band for clerk and servant and for the Governor salary only should be spend on the instruction of the student in military fortification and tactic The average salary of the Professors do not exceed MAJOR wish to know why the office of garrison instructor be allow to be hold by cavalry and infantry officer on and by an officer of the engineer on but not by artillery officer LORD CECIL explain that his view be that these young gentleman should be send in the first place to and then to their regiment and not first to their regiment and then to The salary of the Professors be fix by the Royal Commission say that in spite of recent occurrence at Sir Duncan Cameron be strongly in favour of the present system CAPTAIN intimate that he do not intend to insist on take the sense of the Committee upon the Amendment SIR JOHN have hear a rumour on the subject wish clearly to understand from the right Gentleman the Secretary of State for War whether it be his intention to remove the Duke of York School from Chelsea into the country and to remove the Household Troops from Barracks to the building so leave vacant by the removal of the school He saw no reason for expend a large sum of money upon remove the troop from their present barrack which be excellently situate in the event of the troop be require on an emergency He could not agree with the Baronet opposite the Member for Buckingham Sir Harry that it be desirable to remove the Duke of York School into the country where they might become good agriculturist They have well remain where they be now and become good soldier say he fear he could not give an answer which would be satisfactory to the right Baronet opposite Sir John but this much he might say the Royal Commission recommend that the Duke of York School have good be remove into the country and with that recommendation he be incline to agree but a yet he have arrive at no fixed plan or mature view on the subject He agree with the right Gentleman that the boy ought to be make into soldier and not into agriculturist a it be of great importance to u to have our officer educate at this school and he be happy to state that so far per cent of them go direct into the Army He have no fixed plan for the removal of the Barracks to the present site of the school but he might say that instead of such a removal entail loss to the public it would result in a considerable gain in consequence of the great value of the land on which the barrack now stand The real point however be do a legitimate desire exist for the propose removal of the barrack Not only do he desire it but he should be glad to lend a hand to accomplish that object He be doubtful however whether the site of the Duke of York School would be sufficiently large for the erection of the barrack on it SIR HARRY think that if the boy be bring up in the country they would make good soldier than if bring up in town He be of opinion that it would be an unwise step to sanction the removal of the Barracks Haying take part in the suppression of riotous mob he have see the great advantage of be able to march the heavy cavalry out from that situation from which it could so readily be bring to bear on any part of London COLONEL NORTH say he have also hear with regret the proposal of the War Office to remove those barrack LORD say it be generally think that it would be an improvement if young men be send to before join their regiment instead of afterwards As a father he certainly protest against the use of brandy and soda form a necessary part of the breakfast for these young men He doubt the policy of abolish the grade of ensign a he think the more step there be in a regiment the good It be well that men should have something to look forward to and a change of rank supply that prospect For this reason he think it would be well if the rank of ensign have be retain and young men on first joining have become cadet a in some foreign service FOWLER refer to the expenditure connect with the administration of the Contagious Diseases Acts say he do not wish to revive the disagreeable discussion they have lately have on that subject but he felt it his duty to protest against the present position of affair They have create a new offence make a thing punishable in one town which be not punishable in another and he protest when he be ask to vote the money requisite to carry out the arrangement which follow from that state of thing According to the late statistic it appear that out of person who have undergone an examination within a give period only be send into hospital In other word nearly be compel to submit to that examination though their sanitary condition be good to avoid the penalty of be treat a criminal by their refusal That he submit be a new offence hitherto unknown to the law In his opinion if the system be so beneficial a be say they ought either to abolish it altogether or extend it to every town in the Empire SIR HARRY defend the Acts It be necessary to prevent the propagation of contagious disease alike for the health of the Army and the benefit of the object of the Act He however wish to see the system in question alter not by apply it to every town in the kingdom but by apply it equally to both sex HENLEY point out that this head of expenditure amount altogether to nearly and think the Government with their very economical view would soon take on a regular corp of those particular article and attach them to each regiment and then their system would be complete They would not be able to make a low descent That be not a very pleasant subject to discuss but the course the authority be pursue would soon lead them to that if not to something bad ANDERSON move the reduction of the Vote by of which sum be a proposed increase of the salary of the Military Secretary of the and the salary of an Assistant Secretary a totally new office A few year ago that department have be examine by a Select Committee and the result be that it report that the officer of the Staff refer to be very extravagantly pay Thereupon the salary of the officer call the Military Secretary be reduce by namely from to and that be still in the opinion of those who be acquaint with the fact a very handsome salary for the duty perform Now however there be a proposal to add and provision be likewise make for pay to an assistant secretary He wish to know the reason for those addition Then there be an item of for a new officer call Deputy Adjutant General but he have be inform that that officer be really the head of the Intelligence department and a on the other hand there have be strike off for the office of Chief Clerk he do not propose to object to this part of the Vote As to the other item he have speak of he think them very objectionable and not only would move their omission but would like to ask whether the Treasury have approve of them before they be bring before Parliament SIR HARRY support the Vote It be he say real economy to have an efficient staff and the duty of the office in question be of great importance He therefore hop the Committee would not agree to the reduction at a time when it be more than ever necessary that the administration of the Army should be keep in a state of the high efficiency at In the part of the Vote mention by the Gentleman the Intelligence department he think the increase be justify on the ground that improvement be necessary a evidence by the fact that we lag behind all other country in that respect understand the objection to this part of the Vote be not press ANDERSON Only the and the The simple justification of the creation of a new position in the Military Secretary office be that of late the duty of the Military Secretary have be prodigiously increase by the change which have take place in the organization of the Army itself Of late year a complete record have be keep of the service of every officer in the Army That record be of an extremely confidential character and it could only be entrust to an officer of high stand An assistant have therefore be find to be necessary while the duty of the Military Secretary himself be of so confidential a character a to make it desirable to increase the salary and so secure the service of an officer of high stand The Member for Anderson have ask if the Estimate have be approve of by the Treasury The matter have not yet be finally dispose of by the Treasury and they might be rely on to keep a watchful eye on any increase of expenditure He have simply do his duty in present the Vote to the House COLONEL NORTH say he could bear testimony to the efficiency of the Military Secretary and to the fact that the business of the office have be largely increase through the recent change He would like to ask what the Member for Glasgow Anderson consider to be the duty of the Military Secretary ANDERSON do not think it be his duty to state in detail what be the business of the Military Secretary his object be to prevent unnecessary expenditure He have inform himself however of what be his business at the time the Committee report and probably know as much about it a the and gallant Member who interrogate him There be no public mean of ascertain what he have to do now but he be tell that he have be relieve of many of his duty by the abolition of purchase COLONEL NORTH say the Member bad be very much for the duty of the Military Secretary have be largely increase by the abolition of purchase He hop the Committee would not reduce the Vote ANDERSON object to the introduction of the personal element The matter be one connect with a particular office and not in any way with the officer who happen to hold it They have be tell by the right Gentleman the Secretary of State for War that the Treasury have not approve of the increase He would like to know whether they have disapprove of it or whether they have have it under discussion at all and if so what decision they come to regard it GENERAL SIR GEORGE BALFOUR have personally a high respect for Colonel Egerton the Military Secretary but he object to these increase be make that have take place within the last few year in the cost of the military staff of the Horse Guards and therefore without some good reason than have yet be give he would vote with the Member for Glasgow Anderson He do not object to officer be pay good salary On the contrary he think one of the most objectionable feature of the military system be the miserable salary pay to officer and the excessively large number employ It be that large military staff now keep up for the small Army we maintain that cause the extravagance so much complain of in our military expenditure It be time the Committee set about effect a substantial reduction in the Estimates instead of permit the item to be increase a have be do during the past three year So far from any increase in the cost of the military staff be call for he consider that on the amalgamation of that Staff with the War Office a large decrease in number and cost instead of an increase ought to have be make and until this reform be effect no real decrease in the military expenditure could be look for And if any change in salary consequent on change in duty be need the modification ought to have be carry on by change in the salary of officer whose duty be lessen He must add that he deeply regret to see this propose decrease bring forward by the right Gentleman the Secretary of State SIR PATRICK say he could not agree with the and gallant Member for Oxfordshire Colonel North that none but military men have a right to criticize those Estimates If that be so the best thing to be do be that all the civilian Members should leave the House and let those belong to the military profession vote away the public money a they please He do not think that it would become the Committee to divide on the question whether or not the holder of a high military office be to have an addition of make to his salary or not but at the same time he think that Her Majesty Government be bind to give a sufficient reason for ask the House for this additional sum If the right Gentleman say that it be necessary for the efficiency of the public service that the increase in this officer salary should be make he should vote for that increase and should throw the responsibility of the matter on the right Gentleman He be certainly prise to hear that the duty of the Military Secretary have be increase compare with what they be at the time of Lord Committee for if he recollect aright General Foster who then hold the office be such a glutton for work that he actually perform duty which belong to the It be then resolve to confine him to his proper function and the salary be accordingly reduce It be however now state that the Military Secretary have to keep a record of the military service of each officer a a guide for promotion by selection Could it be state that there have not always be preserve such a record If so it do not matter for what reason it be preserve although now it might be require to carry out the principle of selection and could it be for a moment insist that on this account the salary be to be raise He protest against the reduction of salary at a period of panic when a be here the case Parliament be in a year or two afterwards call upon to increase them COLONEL NORTH inquire whether it be not the fact that the duty of the Military Secretary have not be greatly increase by the abolition of purchase say that the duty of that officer have be considerably increase ANDERSON Has this matter ever be discuss by the Treasury and what answer be give It have be under the consideration of the Treasury and be not approve ANDERSON Was it disapprove It be ANDERSON Yet in the face of that disapproval the right Gentleman bring this increase before the House and endeavour to press it through the House and to compel the Treasury to swallow it whether they like it or not He think he be quite warrant in take the sense of the Committee upon it observe that inasmuch a the question be not finally and absolutely dispose of in his opinion it ought to be bring before the House ANDERSON But it be disapprove say in reply that he still hop it might be approve a he think the refusal have be upon inadequate information LORD enter his protest against the theory that when the head of a Department bring an increase before the House a necessary to the efficiency of his Department he must necessarily be bind by the opinion of the Treasury No Secretary of State worthy of his position would consent to do so a he himself must be the best judge of what be require GENERAL SIR GEORGE BALFOUR remark that no estimate ought to be submit to the House which have not be previously approve by the Treasury This be a recognize principle which have be in force for many year COLONEL NORTH say that nothing could be more straightforward than the manner in which the right Gentleman have put this matter before the House and he consider that the House of Commons be the proper tribunal to determine it ask if there be not a new appointment that of Military Under Secretary at a salary of say that be so The duty be of a very confidential character and be therefore entrust to an officer of high rank GENERAL SIR GEORGE BALFOUR in reply to the call a to whether the Treasury or the Secretary of State be most fit to judge of the want of the Army admit that the Treasury under the present Chancellor of the Exchequer be the most inefficient Department in the State and far less competent than the right Gentleman to form an opinion upon the matter but still it be the rule that no Estimate should be submit to the House which be not approve of by the Treasury and that rule ought to be act upon say that the rule that govern the preparation of the Estimates be that no sum could be enter without the sanction of the Treasury but they reserve to themselves in the case of any establishment the right to review that establishment afterwards DICKINSON consider that no satisfactory reason have be assign for this increase in the salary of the Military Secretary If the duty be heavy now they would in a few year hence be considerably reduce observe that the appointment be only for five year FOWLER hold that the right Gentleman be a good judge of the requirement of his Department than even the Treasury and therefore he would support him He much regret the disposition to cut down to the last sixpence the salary of those who have important duty to perform say that the Chancellor of the Exchequer the Secretary to the Treasury and a Lord of the Treasury have a few moment previously all be stand at the Bar It be observe that the Financial Secretary to the War Office leave his seat to speak to them and the Committee no doubt expect that those right and Gentlemen be thus inform of the difficulty would have give the Committee some enlightenment It must have be remark however that they all disappear suddenly and thus the Committee be still leave in a state of embarrassment He be at a loss to understand in what position the Vote come before the Committee or how they would stand if they pass it admit that he have be place in a difficulty He have recommend an increase in the salary of the Military Secretary the Treasury have withhold it approval and the case be not finally close If however the Treasury persist in object the increase would not be give say that the question be whether the Committee be prepare to Vote that increase of salary contrary to the disapproval of the Treasury Instead of come in to help the Secretary of State for War on this Vote the Chancellor of the Exchequer have bolt out of the House a fast a he could Under those circumstance he must support the Member for Glasgow Anderson HARDY hop that the Committee on a question upon which it be now fully inform would not by strike out the Vote make itself and the head of the Department the slave of the Chancellor of the Exchequer The Military Secretary it appear have now certain record to keep and if the Secretary of State for War think that he ought to have a small increase of salary the Committee ought to vote it irrespective of the opinion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and if that right Gentleman still object it ought not to drive the Secretary of State to commit suicide VERNON HARCOURT repudiate the idea that they should pass Votes merely because they be ask for by a head of a Department but at the same time he would suggest that a the Chancellor of the Exchequer be now in his seat the Committee would hear from him why the Treasury disapprove the increase SIR JOHN think the Committee be place in a position of considerable difficulty The right Gentleman the Secretary of State for War think the salary of the Military Secretary should be increase by The answer of the Treasury be that they disapprove of the increase upon which the Secretary at War be not dispose to submit to the decision of the Treasury and make it a matter of remonstrance The two right Gentlemen should have take care to have the matter settle before bring it before the Committee For himself he would place the opinion of the Secretary of State upon such a question far before that of any Gentleman in the Treasury say that when the salary of the officer in the War Department be they have be settle in relation to the relative standing of the several officer and he disapprove of the violation of that principle The simple fact of increase of duty do not constitute a claim for increase of salary The House and the War Department ought to pause before recommend an increase of the salary which have be fix after an exhaustive departmental inquiry a few year ago COLONEL NORTH remark that the salary of the Military Secretary be reduce because his work would be reduce but it seem that his work have be increase GLADSTONE say it have not be entirely decide by the Treasury whether the salary of the Military Secretary should be increase by As an objection have be take he think it be more regular not to ask the Committee to vote the sum which have not be determine upon Therefore so far a that portion of the Vote be concern it would be withdraw The reason for withdraw it be that the Government have not make up their mind that that be a charge which they ought to ask the Committee to sanction If the Government arrive at the conclusion that the sum ought to be ask for they would ask for it in a Supplemental Estimate ANDERSON believe it wrong to bring forward Votes not approve of by the Treasury because Members on his side of the House look very much to the Treasury for guidance in such matter On the understanding that the Votes would be refer back to them he would withdraw his Amendment FOWLER ask the amount of the salary of the Assistant Military Secretary for India which be pay out of the revenue of India say he be not aware of the precise amount but he would inquire SIR PATRICK ask whether the same rule with reference to Staff appointment which prevail in England under which preference be give to those who have pass the Staff College be in force in India say the discretion a to Indian appointment be with the in India COLONEL say he wish to call attention to a matter which be of vital importance to the Army at large Great discontent prevail amongst officer respect certain thing connect with the abolition of purchase and the other night two serious question be bring before the House of Lords connect with the subject When purchase be abolish officer be assure by the Government that they would be place in no bad position That pledge have not be fulfil He ask whether the right Gentleman could not put an end to the discontent by hand over to some disinterested and proper tribunal the case of those officer in order that it might be ascertain whether there be or be not a real grievance The desertion which have take place during the last few year show that there be also discontent among the private There be not one regiment in Ireland recruit up to it proper strength and yet the House have be tell that everything be go on satisfactorily The question of the of the colonel by the Indian colonel have not be definitely settle and the same be to be say of the and question These be detail into which the right Gentleman do not seem to enter and yet they be grievance which be rankle in the mind of the officer and officer and men say he have yet to learn that he do not go minutely into detail He at any rate spar no pain and do to the best of his ability If the and gallant Gentleman opposite Colonel have himself go into detail he would have know that the question of the prize money be not unsettled that it have not concern him to settle it and that it have be settle by another Department some time ago As to desertion that belong to a period of high wage in the labour market and a period which follow great recruiting when the excitement which have lead to the great recruiting have subside With regard to brevet the and gallant Gentleman have say that by promote a certain portion of the officer who a he have say have be supersede by the Artillery and Engineers he have admit that they have a claim and therefore he ought to have treat them all alike He have however admit nothing of the kind The Committee which have report in favour of improved promotion for the Artillery and Engineers have report in substance that some of the officer of the Line must be supersede and when the right Gentleman opposite Sir John bequeath to him the question a one of great importance and difficulty he do so know perfectly well that when he have overcome those difficulty he must put Artillery and Engineer officer above officer of the Line He have succeed in obtain a degree of promotion with which the House for a time be satisfy The main object of the brevet be this The abolition of purchase have enable meritorious old officer who have be frequently purchase over to be promote from the rank of Captain but it be not possible to repair at once the result of year of purchase by the ordinary regimental promotion and in order to give increased rapidity to the process this brevet have be give As to the discontent respect the abolition of purchase he believe the whole of the have not yet arrive at the War Office and a large number be now undergo examination He hop he would be able to give the result of that examination before long He be not prepare to hold out vague and uncertain expectation He must know what he be do and where he stand before he could give an answer on the subject He have promise that no man should be in a bad position in respect to the commission he hold on the day on which purchase be abolish and he would be surprised if many case be discover in which it have be the case that that pledge have not be fulfil He wish at the same time to remind the Committee that the arm of Parliament be not shorten in this matter and that already money have be vote to meet case of officer where that have be deem necessary WHITWELL notice that out of a list of gentleman who have retire from the service six be under year of age and be under and suggest that there must be other situation in which these gentleman could be usefully employ He wish to have some explanation a to the manner in which these superannuation allowance be grant and how it be that they be grant in some instance to person not much above year of age THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER say that act upon the authority of an Order in Council the Government do everything in their power to find employment in other office for gentleman who have be superannuate but the situation at the disposal of the Government have not be consider good enough for them BARNETT ask under what authority the allowance be make to the yeomanry cavalry Under the Yeomanry Cavalry Regulations"
28815	"DISTRESS OF THE COUNTRY INFLAMMATORY LANGUAGE.]_1830"	"Kenyon wish before the House go into a Committee of Supply to put a question to the right Secretary of State Although his Majesty Speech abstain from all allusion to the topic the right Gentleman could not deny the existence of the great distress throughout the country a distress indeed so deep and extensive that unless mean be take to mitigate it the most serious and alarm consequence might ensue He be anxious to ascertain whether or not it be the right Gentleman intention to propose the appointment of a Select Committee to take the national distress into and to endeavour to devise some plan for it alleviation It be a subject which demand the immediate notice of his Majesty Government and he should be happy to learn what step Ministers mean to take respect it He regret to see a passage in his Majesty Speech which allude to additional coercive measure and he sincerely trust that no such measure would be propose Sir Robert Peel rise to answer the question which the Gentleman have put to him It be not his intention to propose the appointment of a committee to take into consideration the general distress of the country As to the specific measure which his Majesty Ministers intend to adopt he hop that their whole policy would show the disposition which they entertain to advance the prosperity of the country although it could not be expect that he should now enumerate the precise measure that they might take The Gentleman be mistake in suppose that any part of his Majesty Speech allude to measure of coercion What his Majesty state be that he would exert all the exist mean which the law and the constitution have place at his disposal Alderman express his regret that no committee to take the distress of the country into consideration be to be propose by his Majesty Government and his hope that some Member would step forward and make the proposition himself If however the question be not take up by abler hand he should consider it his indispensable duty to move for an investigation of the distress under which the whole country be suffer particularly the labouring class He should not do his duty to his constituent be he not to take this step The question now be not simply whether they would have reformation or not they have to choose between reformation and absolute perdition He have that day heard of a circumstance which prove the great that have take place and that be inevitable in the receipt of the revenue In one district in which the assessed tax have formerly produce there be a deficiency of Although it be his present intention to make the motion to which he have he would readily give way to any Member well qualify for the undertaking and he be above all particularly anxious that he might be relieve from the labour by his Majesty Government a a motion of that kind would come well from it than from any individual Member One of the principal object to which he should feel it his duty to call the attention of the House would be the repeal of the duty on house and windows a duty which press most heavily on a large and valuable portion of the community Stanley request the right the Chancellor of the Exchequer would state the order in which he mean to take the Estimates in the Committee of Supply The Chancellor of the Exchequer say that it be his intention to go regularly through them a in the last Session It be his intention to submit to the House the proposition respect the Civil List on Friday next so that the Committee of Supply would not be require to sit until the Monday after Stanley give notice that on Monday week on the Motion for go into the Committee of Supply he would move certain Resolutions respect the mode in which Parliament and the country have be lead into an expenditure of on the Canal by which a sum to that amount might be in future save to the country Sir John wish to say that he differ in from his and learn friend the member for Waterford on the question of the repeal of the Union In the part of Ireland from which he come the general feeling be decidedly against such a repeal and he be confident that every independent educate and upright person in Ireland be equally oppose to that and learn Gentleman project As to the distress which exist among the people of Ireland that would he believe be best remedied by an advance of money to carry on public work The question be put that the Speaker leave the Chair for the House to resolve itself into a Committee of Supply Hume observe that before the Speaker leave the Chair he wish to inform Members that this be the period at which the Commons of England if they have any complaint to make or any grievance to represent ought to make or represent it If their constituent have commission them for any such purpose now be their time In the execution of his own duty and in compliance with the request of his constituent he now beg to ask his Majesty s Government whether the whole country loudly demand a relief from taxation the Cabinet have make up their mind on that subject a they have make up their mind on the subject of parliamentary reform What he want be an unequivocal answer aye or no The next thing to have a request grant be to put the person by whom it be make out of the misery of suspense The people of England be at present look most anxiously for the relief which they expect would be afford them and they would no longer be put off a they have be heretofore by promise of economy Before therefore he could agree to vote away any of the public money he must ask his Majesty Ministers if it be their intention to alleviate the of taxation which press so heavily upon the country or if they be prepare to propose such a change in the present system of taxation a would remove the severity of the burden from the industrious to other class As to Parliamentary reform it be quite unnecessary for him to ask Ministers what their intention be in that respect after the declaration which have be make elsewhere that the present system of representation be not only good but the best that could possibly be imagine He believe that the noble Duke at the head of the Government and the right Gentleman opposite have declare at Manchester that they have no wish to retain their place except while they be find to act in conformity to the wish of the people When therefore they find that they be not act in conformity to the wish of the people he trust that they would redeem that pledge He hop that the people would show their wish by petition to that House and by all other legal mean He trust however that the people would use no other but legal mean If he could make his voice heard from one end of the country to the other he would exclaim to the people If you wish to obtain your right and to benefit the country abstain from all act of violence From the use of all legal mean of obtain their object the people ought not to allow themselves to be dissuade There be unfortunately in this country a number of very ignorant though perhaps men who be alarm themselves endeavour to disseminate their terror and who wish to sustain the present system under all circumstance depict to others the evil and devastation to which they might be subject if they depart from it a if any change must necessarily lead to occurrence similar to those which have take place in other country He implore every real friend to his country to act himself and to use all the influence which he might possess over others to induce them to act in forward the great object of relieve the people by all lawful mean by petition and remonstrance couch in bold but proper language There be in that and the other House of Parliament so many individual who be interested in the continuance of the present system because it work well a it respect them that they adopt every possible mean of insure it continuance It be not surprising that these should say to those over whom they possess any influence Do go to this meeting or that assembly Do sign such a petition Do join in such a remonstrance That however be not the advice which ought to be give to the people by person who be not interested in the maintenance of the exist abuse When he consider of what the Duke of Wellington have show himself capable in other situation he confess that he be astonish at his present conduct He must have receive his political impression from other country Austria Russia must have press their opinion upon him However let his Majesty Ministers now declare whether or not they intend to propose the reduction of the public aye or no He should be satisfy with either answer But he wish unequivocally now to know what step they intend to take and he would state why He confess he have look to them with hope and expectation He speak of it with regret but weak a he be he have be the dupe of the expression of his Majesty Government in the former Session The right Gentleman opposite have declare in the last week of the last Parliament in answer to some very strong and pertinent observation from the and learn member for Yorkshire that he might rest perfectly satisfy a to the measure which his colleague and himself mean to pursue for that they should call on the people for support Did the right Gentleman or the Duke of Wellington mean to say that the people of England do not want reform that they do not want reduction of taxation or that they do want any interference in the affair of Belgium After that declaration he Hume have hop that he should hear in his Majesty Speech some expression of due consideration for the suffering of the people Those suffering be great but they be wholly disregard they be set at nought There be not even a paragraph in reference to them in his Majesty Speech He be apprehensive that some very insidious design be on foot So much confidence have he in the good sense of the working class of the community that he be very much afraid that the belief of the member for Kent that the outrage which have be commit there be not the work of the population of the country be well found When he couple this with the other proceeding of the noble Duke loud laughter and cry of hear hear Perhaps he be wrong in use the word other But he really have a poor opinion of those who be so easily lead to laugh at a lapse of that kind but who would perhaps let a good joke pas unnoticed He really lament to see on all occasion however serious such a levity of manner in the House It could not be necessary for him to say that he do not think the Duke of Wellington have have anything to do with the fire in Kent All these thing however be make a deep impression in every part of the country It behove his Majesty Government if there be any mean of remedy the evil to use them He now beg to put the question to the right Gentleman what his Majesty Government meant to do He have put a question to the right Gentleman yesterday which he have not have the courtesy to answer He hop that the right Gentleman would answer his present question and that the answer would be that the member of the Cabinet have make up their mind to relieve the suffering of the people by reduce the of taxation Sir Robert Peel express his surprise that the member for Middlesex should charge him with want of courtesy in not answer his question yesterday What he have understand the Gentleman to say yesterday be that he would put to him Sir Robert Peel this day a question a to the probability of the of war He have intend if the Gentleman have this day repeat his question to have answer that a perfect confidence might be entertain that the same motif which have hitherto induce his Majesty Government to pursue a pacific policy would continue and that his Majesty Government would make every possible effort consistently of course with the honour and permanent interest of England to maintain peace with the whole world His Majesty Government be deeply interested in the preservation of the general tranquillity His Majesty in his Speech from the Throne declare that the assurance of a friendly disposition which he continue to receive from all foreign Powers justify the expectation that he should be enable to preserve for his people the blessing of peace It be impossible for him consistently with his duty to say more on the subject than that since that declaration from the Throne nothing have occur to change or diminish the expectation which his Majesty have be induce to entertain that he should be enable to preserve for his people the blessing of peace The member for Middlesex now ask and require a positive and decisive answer to the question whether his Majesty Government intend to propose any reduction of taxation He be confident that on reflection the Gentleman experience would show him that the question be a very improper one He must certainly decline give any answer to the question either affirmatively or negatively But suppose he be to answer the question affirmatively do not the Member well know that such an answer must be follow up at once by enumerate the specific object to which the intend reduction be to be apply No inference whatever ought to be draw from his decline to answer the question except that to do so would be inconvenient to the public He appeal to every Member of parliamentary experience if anything could be more prejudicial than for one of his Majesty Ministers at the commencement of a Session to give any answer to such a question a that which the Gentleman have put to him The Gentleman talk of some pledge which he Sir Robert Peel have give last Session of the disposition of his Majesty Government to defer to public opinion What he have state last Session be this fact that his Majesty Government have make such an extensive reduction in the patronage of the Crown that no administration could rely upon the permanent possession of office unless they felt themselves support by the confidence of Parliament and the country But the Gentleman must not conclude from that declaration that any vulgar or common opinion though express by the Gentleman would at all influence him in the discharge of his duty If the Gentleman join in the vulgar imputation on public men that they be unduly influence by their wish to retain the paltry emolument of office if he think it necessary to caution the people against listen to the advice of such person because they be interested in give that advice he know not by what test the Gentleman be prepare to prove the truth of his insinuation but he know that they be most uncharitable and most unjust The only consideration which his Majesty Government have in contemplation be the welfare of the people and their permanent interest The people must judge of their motif by their measure If the House and the country suspect the motif and condemn the measure of his Majesty Ministers no inherent power or influence they possess could maintain them in the Administration When the Gentleman talk of the proceeding of misguided men he would ask him if the language which have be use in that House by himself now the representative of the metropolitan county and therefore perhaps possess of a degree of importance great than he have before enjoy he would ask him whether the language which he have use in the course of the present Session be not calculate to produce excitement and inflammation When the Member characterise the whole population of the country without exception a be in a starving condition a reduce to a state of actual famine or when he declare that unless certain measure be adopt the day of vengeance would come might not the excitement and inflammation which the Gentleman lament be unintentionally aggravate by the unguarded language he employ Colonel Davies protest against the practice of taunt Members when they remonstrate against the measure of Government with a disposition to inflame and excite the people He have never hear from his friend any expression which justify such taunt What his friend have say the other evening have be fully and satisfactorily explain although it might suit the purpose of the right Gentleman for the purpose of make an undue impression on the House to state his own version of the matter When his friend talk of interested person he do not allude to such person a the right Gentleman but to underling to and others who be of course all interested in the maintenance of the present system It be to such person that his friend allude not to such person a the right Gentleman He would do the right Gentleman the justice to say that he do not believe he be influence by any love of paltry emolument or of place He have already show that he be superior to any such miserable consideration But that have no influence on his opinion of the public conduct of his Majesty Government and he would say that if they be not the most discreet and clever of Ministers they be as bold a any that ever exist not even except Prince The Duke of Wellington have express his determination to resist every specie of reform He have go so far a to tell the House of Lords that if he be to form a Legislature he would create one not equal in excellence to the present for that he could not expect to be able to do but something a nearly of the same description a possible The right Gentleman not to be with his noble colleague have tell them that even forsooth that his Majesty Government be not prepared to say that they have any intention of reduce the taxation of the country If person suffer distress felt disaffection whose fault be it Was it not the fault of those who drive them into cherish that feeling by resist the sign of the time The best friend of the Ministers be those who tell them the real condition of the country their bad enemy be those who blind them to that condition Was it possible that on so important a subject a the reduction of taxation his Majesty Government have not be able in the course of so many month to come to a decision If any resolution have be form why not answer his friend question Not have do so they must expect to have every obstacle throw in their way and to find the public business impede if not altogether stop rise to ask whether the member for Middlesex who generally speak with great courtesy of public men intend to revoke the expression which he have use when he insinuate or rather say that the noble Duke be at the bottom of the burning in Kent He think that it would be for the interest of the public for the House to come at once to a regular division on the conduct of Ministers instead of waste time in a Guerilla warfare on such discussion a the present Such a division would bring on the tug of war and the country would then know how far the Ministry be likely to enjoy the confidence of the present Parliament Hume say that he rise out of courtesy to the Member who have just sit down although he believe that he might appeal to the whole House that there be no necessity after what he have formerly say to reply at all to the Member question He could assure the Member that if he think that either the Duke of Wellington or any other of his Majesty Ministers be capable of such conduct he should lose not a moment nay he should be foremost in bring that subject under the immediate consideration of Parliament Baring say that he rise with reluctance to prolong a discussion of so tedious and unsatisfactory a nature but certain circumstance which have occur in the debate and certain expression which have be use by his friend the member for Middlesex appear to him to be of such a nature that they ought not to be pass over without notice As far a his own experience go he must say that it be quite clear that we have not have since the conclusion of the war any period in which the essential interest of the country be move more satisfactorily than they be move a few month ago He do not mean to say that they be move with enormous profit and splendid result all he mean to say be that the return of our commerce though moderate be still satisfactory When the great event which have recently occur upon the Continent become know on this side of the Channel they have a tendency to produce general excitement in one quarter and general apprehension in another two cause which have in some degree but not to any great extent be prejudicial to the interest of our commerce From the year to the commencement of the year we have be in circumstance of difficulty from the manner in which we have tamper with the currency during the last year we have be recover from the fever into which our former measure have cast u and with a little management and forbearance he believe that would soon be complete If there be any one thing which every man who wish well to his country and especially to the labouring class ought to avoid more than another it be disturb the general tranquillity by those outrageous and extravagant assertion which be now so rife among u and which with all due regard to his friend the member for Middlesex whose great service he be at at all time ready to acknowledge he must say have be utter by him with more than usual vehemence on the present occasion If it be true that the majority of the Members of that House act upon mere mercenary view without any regard to public principle if it be true that the Majority of them be receive large emolument out of the public purse a fact which he for one do not believe the sooner those circumstance be clearly explain to the country the good would it be for it interest He therefore could not help express a hope that the motion which the member for Colchester intend to make in a few night call for a return of the emolument civil and military receive by Members of that House would be grant in order that the extent of those emolument might be distinctly know It be however his opinion that a more extravagant and if unfounded a more mischievous misrepresentation than this have never be propound by any public man in any country That public men hold public office be to be pay by the country be a principle of our Constitution which have always be applaud by the best Judges of Constitutional policy both at home and abroad Several of the most acute statesman in America have express their approbation of our practice of allow the great officer of Government to have seat in Parliament and have lament that a similar practice be not permit in their own country Unless his friend the member for Middlesex be prepare to say that the great office of State should be without emolument and should therefore be monopolize by men of large fortune a practice most injurious in a mixed democracy like our own the present system of allow individual who receive salary for fill efficient situation under the Crown could not be dispense with The assertion of the member for Middlesex on this subject might surprise those Gentlemen who be new Members of the House but they would produce no effect upon those who like him have sit for year in Parliament and have witness the great reduction which have be make of late year in all our establishment For his own part he must say that he be not aware that the great officer of State be at all If they be let his friend when the estimate come before the House point out where the be and he think that he might appeal to his own past conduct in Parliament to show that he should not be backward in concur in any reduction which could be fairly and properly and safely make But in the present state of the public mind which in spite of the exemplary moderation exhibit by the Majority of the nation be still a little excited there be no occasion for public men to make use of inflammatory language to promote a state of thing which if it arrive would be productive of as much injury to themselves a it would be to the rest of the country In a placard which he have see post up that day he saw it state that out of the public money the Earl of Eldon receive a year Hume Does that originate with me If not why mention it Baring My friend do me gross injustice when he suppose that I be go to make my speech entirely about him I be mention an exaggerated statement which I have see in a placard out of door and be proceed to correct it My friend get up to correct and stop me but I never know him get up to remove an exaggeration though I hold it to be as much the duty of a public man to remove exaggeration a it be to detail fairly the real grievance of his country But to proceed I saw in that same placard a list of other exaggeration equally unfounded with that which I have just mention Of that noble Lord in his political character at least it be pretty well know that I never have be an admirer but yet I think it only common justice to state that that noble Lord receive no more than a pension of a year a a retire Chancellor and I doubt whether any man who recollect the laborious service of Lord Eldon for so many year a a Judge will say that such a retire pension be too much If it be let it be bring fairly under our consideration and not make the subject of the most unfounded exaggeration Baring then proceed to observe that it be impossible to see such exaggeration without be sensible of the object for which they be make Knowing that the Members of the House of Commons be good for nothing if they do not follow up the opinion of those hundred and thousand of people out of door who from the general spread of education be able to judge of them their proceeding and their merit he would proclaim at once the idleness of endeavour to conceal from them anything which have a tendency to display the mode of expend the public money but at the same time he would proclaim a a general rule the duty of public men show up and disavow the exaggeration which be abroad on such a subject With regard to the question which have be put to the right Gentleman opposite a to his intention to repeal any tax he would only say that the best course which the House could adopt would in his opinion be that of go into the Committee of Supply and there perform the business of the public If in that committee the Minister should propose any grant which Gentlemen might deem improper then would be the time and there would be the place for object to it Let Gentlemen therefore consider in the first place whether it be practicable to reduce the supply for if such a scheme be practicable then they might properly think of reduce the amount of taxation In conclusion he admit that distress of some kind must always be find in a large manufacturing country like our own but he deny that at present it be anything like that which have generally prevail in the country since the conclusion of the last peace It be a gross exaggeration to describe the English a a starve people Any difficulty by which the country be affect at present have arise from the which prevail on one hand and from the apprehension which prevail on the other He be sorry however to be compel to observe that the course which have be pursue that evening be calculate to increase it materially Lord complain that the member for have read his friend the member for Middlesex a most unnecessary and lecture on the exaggeration which be abroad and of which his friend be perfectly guiltless He contend that the exaggeration prevalent out of door be a sufficient justification of any Member who calmly and dispassionately state within the House the real grievance of the people The language which have be use by the member for Middlesex both on the present and on a former night be perfectly justifiable in the present state of the country With respect to reform in Parliament he must say that it be resist only by those who have an interest in maintain the present abuse By abuse he do not mean the high and extravagant salary merely which be pay to some public officer but the influence and patronage which be in the gift of some of them and quite a valuable if not more so than money He must also condemn in the strong term the declaration contain in the King Speech respect Belgium and avow his dissatisfaction with the explanation which the right Secretary have that night give respect what he call the pacific intention of the British Government Sir Peel repeat his former declaration that our interference with the Netherlands be not make with a view of excite but of prevent war His Majesty have declare in his Speech that he entertain the expectation that he should be able to preserve for his people the blessing of peace and he have already assure the House and he would repeat the assurance that nothing have occur since the delivery of that Speech which induce him to think that that expectation would be disappoint In reply to the observation of the member for Worcester which he say proceed throughout upon the erroneous supposition that he have accuse the Gentlemen opposite of throw firebrand among the people he should only say that he have make no such accusation On a former evening he have use the word intentionally where he intend to have say unintentionally On the present occasion he have lay particular emphasis on the word unintentionally when he say that an Member be use language which be calculate unintentionally on his part to create great excitement and inflammation among the people He repeat his assertion that such language have be use He ask whether it be consistent with truth to call the people of England a starving population There might be partial distress in the country some distress there always must be from the very nature of thing but it be a gross exaggeration to say that the people of England be starve He acquit the Member as freely a the Member acquit the Duke of Wellington of all intention to do mischief but when he say that in his opinion the Government ought to be displace there be a good and a mild way of say it than by use such a phrase a the day of vengeance will come When the Member be talk of a misguided and easily excited people it be well to avoid use such language wish to take that opportunity of ask the right Gentleman a question Had any report be receive from the commission appoint last Session to inquire into the finance and expenditure of the Colonies The Chancellor of the Exchequer say that the commissioner have not yet complete their work though they have make considerable progress in it The result of their labour would however be shortly place before the public"

which have attend them at least entitle him in my opinion to the ready acquiescence in his wish and to the large measure of and support in his view which the opinion and ability of any friend of his enable you to afford My Lords I have speak of the subject of this Bill a one which comparatively speak have occupy little of your Lordships time and attention I have nevertheless the satisfaction of feel that I be not under the difficulty of recommend to your Lordships the adoption of any new principle of legislation and still less of any origination in this House of any proposition whatever My Lords the measure now propose for your acceptance have originate in far different quarter than in the mind of one so little entitled to your Lordships attention a myself They have originate in the crowded receptacle of human labour they have be elaborate in the factory and the alley amid the whirl of machinery and in those long row of lodge house which grow up around the giant chimney of Lancashire and Yorkshire This Bill have it root in the stern experience of the husband and the father From this humble but I be sure in your Lordships view not contemptible seed the idea have mount upwards in the shape of such petition a those which have encumber your Lordships Table Men of high education men whose life be one professional and practical exercise of philanthropy have assist the progress of the measure to the ear of the Legislature by their sanction and their advocacy medical men in every branch of practice clergyman of every religious persuasion Springing from such a source found on such a basis of feeling and opinion it have make it way through much difficulty against powerful opposition till it have obtain the sanction of an influential portion of the Cabinet of a conclusive majority of the House of Commons and so supported and recommend have reach the Table of your Lordships House I state these thing my Lords not for the purpose of induce any one of your Lordships to abdicate your privilege of free discussion or of deliberate Latest and least of the accession to your Lordships House I should be sorry to signalize my first at address your Lordships by propose any surrender of your independence any infraction of your privilege Considering however the nature of the question at issue consider that in the majority which have sanction this measure elsewhere consider that every point have be argue elsewhere by men who have stand on their own weary foot at the mule and piece the thread with their own hand and who by the strong exercise of that strong intelligence which appear to me an indigenous plant of the manufacturing district of England by their perseverance in honest industry have raise themselves to the House of Commons I ask yon this at least I ask you to receive this Bill with something of that deference with which some month ago I a a Member of the House of Commons should have receive some measure of equity law perchance which have come down to that House have pass through the ordeal of those legal mind which adorn and instruct and in such measure greatly govern your Lordships deliberation My Lords the principle of this Bill have be impugn a involve legislative interference with the right of capital and labour I might slur over this objection on the ground of repeat precedent In the House of Commons I would do so but address your Lordships who have be less engage with the subject I think it more respectful briefly to attempt my own vindication on this head I be not one of those who presume out of their own ignorance or idleness to cast reflection on the acute and laborious men who have devote themselves to the science of political economy nor be I a sceptic a to the general validity of the main tenet of that school nor an impugner of the truth which it profess to have demonstrate I be prepared however if necessary to contend that I be advocate nothing inconsistent with the doctrine of political economy at all I do not wish to enter at length on such ground but I would much rather refer your Lordships to an argument which you will find in the debate deliver by a noble Earl now on the Ministerial bench who draw the just distinction between restriction on labour and capital devise to increase wealth and those intend for other purpose to guard against want and physical evil My Lords I dislike a meddling Government I believe with him that for the creation of the great producible wealth in any give community and therefore for the wide diffusion of that material which attend the production of wealth the policy of abstinence from legislative meddling be the surest policy and therefore I think it incumbent on any one who depart from that policy to assign distinct ground for his justification The master manufacturer and the operative have both a right I admit it to say to me you be interfere with my free action you be select mine from a crowd of other occupation to make it the subject of experimental legislation I claim an explanation I demand an exceptional reason for your conduct My Lords I find that justification a most of your Lordships will anticipate in the inherent inalienable tendency of that agent which Watt force into the service of man a apply to the four great branch of our textile industry which come under the provision of this Bill I mean the tendency in the first instance to attract to it ministration the labour of those whom in respect of age or sex or both nature never intend for hard and continuous labour and next in it tendency to make that labour continuous and unceasing and protract to a limit of physical and mental endurance which in my opinion no Christian Legislature can see it subject approach without acknowledge the duty of interfere if it can interfere for their relief and protection It be on this ground my Lords that find a I do with regard to these branch of industry the mean and opportunity of interference I claim the right to exercise them I say my Lords find the mean and opportunity for this also be an essential element of practical interference and be my reply to an argument which though often use be I think singularly inconclusive to a course of reason very commonly adopt towards any man who be hunt down a particular grievance and which endeavour to divert his attention by point out fifty other object in pursuit My Lords there be doubtless enough of abuse and misery and oppression in the world to make a sentimental or flighty philanthropist fold his arm in despair My Lords I invite your Lordships to interfere with these large collective aggregation of labour because theory and experience tell me you can do so with effect because they be open to inspection and capable of control because you can do much to prevent abuse and if the hard necessity arise to punish it I be aware that this very feature of the case have be allege a a reason for it have be say that the factory system be the very department of our industry in which abuse and oppression be most discoverable and can least escape detection We have be repeatedly tell that we take an view of the effect of the use of machinery that it be the great of the sum of mental and physical labour the fertile source of leisure and contentment and that we should be cautious how we meddle with it operation I admit these fact but I demand your Lordships attention to some further fact connect with the employment of that fixed and expansive capital into the scope and effect of which it become a duty from which a a legislator I can not shrink from inquire There be in my opinion no grander result of human intelligence than a large cotton mill but I say this of it that from the moment it engine be start raise by the capital and govern by the will of the acute and enterprising individual who sit in it office it become the direct interest of that preside genius that it motion should be a unceasing and continuous a human contrivance can make them that there be no part of that vast system of wheel and lever which can rest without loss or in the ordinary and average course of commercial prosperity pursue it motion without gain The human labour attach hand and foot to that system for the most part admit not of relay What be the natural the inevitable consequence of this Why that which have result that with which step by step gradually cautiously effectually and successfully you have be endeavour for thirty year to moderate and curtail in wise defiance of the stated principle of political economy That the strong impulse of gain be place in direct and dangerous antagonism with the claim of humanity that it almost invariably prevail in the struggle a for a time it be leave and if leave to itself unchecked and uncontrolled it reduce a part of your population to the condition of slavery unmitigated by that interest in the physical of the party which do operate on the of Carolina My Lords such thing have be to prevent them you have repeatedly interfere and your exertion have not be in vain Now my Lords do the same reason hold good with other department of human industry in which machinery of human contrivance be less I say machinery of human contrivance for I hold that in some sense the earth itself be a machine that the clod of the valley in which you drop the germ of future vegetation be as much a machine a that in which you deposit your portion of raw cotton In another place my Lords I take the liberty of tell the lord of the soil that in this point of view I consider them a monster manufacturer and I that opinion here Your Lordships in the management of hereditary estate which have descend to you from the Conquest be connect with machinery as well a Greg but my Lords there be a difference between the machinery of God contrivance and that of his creature The earth will work alone in the silence of night under the star of heaven unlit by your gas unfed by your fire admit at interval which nature indicate the regulated assistance of man take him into partnership but with no direct tendency to make him it slave Such my Lords be the consideration which have induce me to overcome the repugnance I individually entertain to meddle with concern which from their magnitude and complexity I dread to approach If they act upon your Lordships mind a they have act upon mine a they have already in repeat instance act upon the Legislature at large the question of principle be dispose of and we enter upon the more delicate and practical consideration of the degree to which we shall extend our interference My Lords after long discussion after repeat consideration the House of Commons have decide so far a that branch of the Legislature can decide that the labour of woman and young person under year of age shall be limit to ten hour of work exclusive of the two which be necessary for refreshment I be bind to state though no one of your Lordships can be ignorant of the fact that from the necessary of the hand of different age and sex in the operation of the manufacture this provision will include in it indirect operation those whom it do not directly affect Adult man be not affect directly by it but I can by no mean avail myself of that circumstance in argue a to the real effect of the measure well know this the adult population of the manufacturing district so far from shrink from the consequence be to an enormous extent interested in it by your Lordships I believe that an overwhelming of it be at this moment tremble with expectation perhaps with just apprehension that the cause they support may suffer prejudice from my own incapacity a an advocate I do not state this a an argument to your Lordships I admit it but a a subordinate consideration to myself I think it an unquestionable collateral advantage that it acceptance will realize hope which have be entertain and foster since the attempt of the late Sir Peel in whose measure which be on the verge of completion be nearly a of the present I think it a vast advantage that it will put a close to a peaceful and orderly but an intense and peculiar agitation but I do not state this a a reason for influence your Lordships better I think a Bill support by such majority in the House of Commons entitle to much respect but I be not here to register the decision of that House or to induce your Lordships to do so I accept this measure because we find after some hesitation after listen much and think much and speak a little I think it a beneficial bargain by which the party to be affect will obtain certain advantage of incalculable importance to them at a risk of certain sacrifice which it be not possible precisely to calculate but which will leave at the least the balance of advantage largely in favour of those who have to make them Two main objection have be take to the measure two principal and inevitable consequence have be hold out a certain to ensue It be say that by strike off a twelfth from the time during which when employment be rife you be at present able to labour you will either diminish wage or cause defeat from foreign competition I be not hound throughout to argue with those who predict both these consequence because I think the one consequence lose in connexion with the other For the first of these consequence I have always advise those with whom I have be in communication to be prepared and I have certainly always receive the advice that to the best of their ability they have count the cost and be prepare on behalf of themselves and their family to encounter it I be not fond of prophesy in matter of this description but if on the one hand I be not prepared to risk my reputation for accuracy on a calculation of the exact effect upon wage on the other I ask any man to favour me with a calculation of the amount of actual domestic economy which may be effect by the mother of three child who return to her home two hour sooner than at present I can not calculate this because I can not sew I can not darn I can not wash and I can not cook still less can I calculate the evanescent quantities the social effect of leisure and repose to the mind or lay down in advance statistical result on bodily health or longevity I have no doubt whatever that the average sum total of these element if they could be calculate would show a to any probable diminution of money wage which will one day be satisfactory to those who have cooperate in pass this measure On this subject I must also call your Lordships attention to another circumstance the deduction be make when the article be bring in by the operative for waste and spoil My Lords from such information a I can obtain it be my firm belief that of that spoil will arise in the last weary hour of the operative present average toil I have never meet with any man of any class conversant with the subject who have not lay much stress on this circumstance I pass my Lords to the question of foreign competition I do not profess to receive with indifference from men for whose station acquirement and ability I have profound respect their idea on this subject but I be console by the reflection that no step have be take in this matter which have not be precede by similar warning of ruin and similar threat of emigration by them which I doubt not have assail many of your Lordships a they have assail me And yet my Lords I hold in my hand a paper which show that England have yet hold her own against the competition of the world and which lead me to think that if she be allow to suffer decay it will originate rather in a diminished supply of the raw material than in any legislation which for the sake of the high interest of humanity we may have consent to adopt My Lords I must say that the language of some of these party have vary very much with circumstance in a very short space of time I be address many now who retain through evil report and good the opinion which they have uniformly express in favour of restriction on the free importation of corn but I doubt whether the stern adherent to that system would not admit that whilst those restriction exist the case of the master a an opponent to this Bill do not present a difficulty in the way of limit the hour of labour My Lords I speak for myself at least and say I have no occasion to broach what be then urge by the From what I have lately hear I can hardly believe that the old corn law and the duty on raw cotton be not still on the I look for them there in vain but I also listen in vain for a repetition of language which be use at the period when a struggle be go on for their removal Then the grievance and the evil of long hour be admit then the factory delegate be tell it be true that overwork be decrease your stature but do not agitate for the immediate alteration of those law Join u in agitate to remove the real obstacle to that measure and that remove you shall gain your object at least with our consent if not with that active which might be too much to expect My Lords such be the nature of the language and I have proof of it use by some Gentlemen who doubtless in the heat of the moment in the ardour of pursuit of a great political object think and intend what they say but who now discover that free trade and relief from duty be no guarantee against the danger and be not to be speak of a a palliative of the effect of foreign competition My Lords I believe that from a concourse of circumstance peculiar to the character of this nation England be in a condition to set an example to the world in this matter a she have do in others that she be able to do right and fear not and more than this that her example will be follow and that foreign statesman who may not be dispose to follow it will be press by that influence of public feeling and opinion which be act upon ourselves If I look to I see the evidence already on record in the act of her Government and I find that the proceeding of that Government be directly found on that example of England which I trust will still prevail I know nothing in the character of the French nation which induce me to suppose that public feeling will he far behind our own in the consideration of this subject I have in my hand at this moment some reason to think that French statesman be direct their attention to what be pass in England and be look on in a spirit of approbation It be a letter address to Lord Ashley by Baron Charles Paris May My Lord Can I inquire from your kindness to know whether the third reading of the Ten Hours Bill shall soon take place and whether this Bill shall likely pass into the House of Lords before the end of this Session I have now to write a report for a new law relating to the protection of child in our factory I have peruse anew all your benevolent exertion in favour of child and I shall be happy to present them to the esteem and admiration of my countryman I be my Lord with the high consideration your most obedient servant BARON CHARLES Pair de France To Lord Ashley What have be hitherto that answer to all who in the various other country of the world have be dispose to check the evil of excessive toil Why that no step could be take in advance while England maintain her ground With respect to Spain I have a statistical account of it cotton manufacture The total number of in all Spain be average power of each horse aggregate power horse Total number of aggregate power of horse average power of each wheel horse Total number of mill work by animal power average power of mill horse aggregate power of mill horse Total number of in all Spain total number of cotton spindle average number of spindle in each mill Two hundred and sixty day of twelve work hour in a year average number each spindle produce on an average three ounce of No per day of twelve hour LORD second the Motion He think that the present measure be one of the great importance to the moral and social welfare of the operative class employ in the manufacture in this kingdom and if carry would enhance the national honour and character The people deserve this measure They have for many year beseech Parliament to grant them a Ten Hours Bill and he think that the manner in which they have agitate the question entitle them to the most favourable consideration of the Legislature They have seek to obtain it by the most peaceable mean they have never have recourse to violent agitation to strike or combination against their employer They never have commit a breach of the peace at any of the great meeting hold upon this question but their conduct have always be characterize by regularity and by manifestation of loyalty It would therefore be only an act of justice to those loyal peaceable and industrious men to pass this Bill The question of wage have be discuss at the public meeting over and over again At the meeting in Yorkshire and in Scotland the question be invariably submit to the work people Were they or be they not prepare to submit to a reduction of wage in case that should be the consequence of the passing of this measure and their answer always be Rather than lose the benefit we anticipate will result from this Bill we be willing to submit to a reduction of wage It appear to him that one great advantage of this measure would be more constant employment and a more regular rate of wage without those fluctuation which attend the present system and he think that in an average of year there would not be any diminution in the amount of wage Whenever this subject have be bring forward in Parliament it have always be prophesy that it would ruin the manufacturer but in no instance have these prediction be verify Would so large a number of master manufacturer have support the measure if it have be of so ruinous a character Who be the individual that bring the Bill into the other House of Parliament It be the Member for Oldham who have spend a long life in conduct a large manufacturing establishment and who have rear up his son in the same occupation and it be support by upwards of a thousand of the principal master manufacturer From the practical knowledge which such men a these possess they entertain no apprehension that this Bill would inflict any injury upon the manufacturer of the country With respect to the argument that legislation upon this subject would ruin the manufacturer of this country he would remind their Lordships of what have be already do in relation to it and of the effect which have be produce thereby With respect to legislation on this subject in the late Sir Robert Peel a Bill for limit the number of hour during which child of certain age should work at certain employment In another Bill be bring in have a more general application but the matter be then refer to a Committee which take evidence upon it and amongst others the late Sir Robert Peel himself bore testimony to the necessity of such limitation The Bill do not succeed in that year but in a Bill be carry regulate the hour of labour for child from to year of age In another Bill be introduce and in Sir introduce a Bill limit the hour of labour to ten for child under Another Committee be then appoint Practical men of various class be examine before that Committee and a great number of medical men of the high reputation bore their testimony to the serious consequence result from the absence of the limitation then propose Subsequently a Motion be make for a Commission to collect further evidence and that Commission have issue and the evidence have be take the report of three Commissioners confirm these statement in every respect The result of all these inquiry be that Lord introduce a Bill by which the system of relay be establish and in Sir Graham bring in another Bill to reduce the hour of labour from nine to eight with regard to child below the age of So the question go on from to the result be that the hour of factory labour have be greatly ameliorate He would now show their Lordships what have be the result a affect the cotton trade and the manufacture of this country The noble Lord read account of the consumption of cotton wool in our between and namely that in the consumption be lbs in lb while in it amount to lbs an increase between those year of per cent All experience therefore be in favour of the measure even with reference to it effect upon our manufacture But the evil consequence of long hour of labour in restrict the mean of instruct the labouring demand the serious consideration of their Lordships for it be impossible that that could be in a satisfactory condition unless the hour of labour be reduce and it be certain that the effect of the present duration be to induce neglect of the ordinance of the Sabbath He hop therefore under all the circumstance of this most important case that their Lordships would not refuse their consent to the second reading of this Bill He be not aware what course would he take by Her Majesty Government upon the subject in that House but he would fain hope that they would be unanimous in favour of the Bill In the other House of Parliament the noble Lord at the head of the Government have most honourably redeem the pledge he give to his constituent in the city of London in the autumn of last year when address them he tell them that one of the most important subject which Her Majesty Government would take into their consideration be the moral and social improvement of the people with the view of raise their condition and character This Bill be indeed only a part but it be by no mean an unimportant or insignificant part of the great question The noble Lord have however redeem the pledge he give on the part of the Government for although he be in favour of an Eleven Hours Bill yet after he find that there be a large majority in favour of a Ten Hours Bill rather than that the measure should be reject he give his vote in favour of the third reading of this Bill Measures have be pass by Parliament which have benefit the master manufacturer the duty on wool have be repeal the corn law have be repeal and it have be hold out to the working class that after the corn law have be repeal they should have this measure The Earl of be not aware of any such understanding There might not have be a positive pledge but there be a general understanding upon the subject With respect to the principle of political economy which this measure be suppose to contravene there be on the other hand to be consider the principle of humanity of justice and of the Christian religion and he trust that the cordial zealous and he hop unanimous support of their Lordships would be give to a Bill which would confer a great benefit and boon upon the working class LORD BROUGHAM say he be sorry to interrupt the unanimity of the House but he for one and he hop he should not be the only one look at this measure with great alarm The more he have consider this measure since it be first pound some two year ago and especially latterly since it be accept by the other House of Parliament the more alarm he have felt He be happy to see present so large a number of the occupant of the Episcopal Bench for he have no manner of doubt that they have be induce to attend from the discussion which they have read on this subject and from the tendency which it have be represent to have to promote the comfort of the working and more unfortunate class of the community and from it connexion thereby with a cause ever so dear to their heart and which be place under their superintendence the moral and religious concern of the people He should however do his endeavour by Divine assistance to lay before them such view of this question in it relation to the real good of the working class in relation to the moral and religious interest of those class in relation to the only chance they ever could have of improve themselves in temporal matter and of carry on with that an improvement also in their moral and religious condition he should endeavour by address himself mainly and principally to those consideration to show the right reverend Prelates that this Bill be not such a measure a they ought to support for he be one of those who regard it a enough that the whole or nearly the whole of this question be bind up in the interest of the working class It be not on account of the capitalist or the commercial class of the country nor of the upper class of the community that he view this question with anxiety and this measure with alarm but it be on account of the poor and work people of the country those who have no capital who drive no trade either domestic or foreign those whose only wealth be the labour of their hand and who gain their only profit by the sweat of their brow that he oppose this measure and it be his deep and conscientious belief a belief strengthen by his experience ever since he enter public life or be able to reason on such subject that the interest of this large class above all other interest require that no interference should be suffer or by any power in the State attempt with the free employment of that which be their only wealth their only capital and their only mean of subsistence the labour and honest industry of their hand It might be object to him that he be about to enter into the consideration of this question on the almost forbidden ground of political economy but there be no connexion between the question and the doctrine of political philosophy except this that if these doctrine be sound and be found on plain common sense and be the result of every day experience then every part of the proposal make in this Bill be an outrage on that common sense and an ostentatious neglect of the lesson teach by that experience To relieve himself however from the odium which might attach to him on this ground he would ask if it require a person to be a political economist to be able to say that if a man hitherto have be allow to work hour but be now prevent by law from work more than hour he be not likely to do the same amount of work and have the same amount of wage a before This be not political economy it be judge of the matter by the doctrine of plain common sense and the result be the same whether they try it in good say or in time If a man for spin twelve ell of got be it not clear that for of that amount he would only get It be admit on all hand and his noble Friend who commence the debate admit it frankly because there could not be a doubt of it that there must be a reduction of wage if the operative class be not allow to work the same number of hour Having relieve himself from the odium connect with this point he would observe that this be a question which ought to impose upon their Lordships great caution prudence and circumspection a one affect large and important interest Our export amount one year with another to somewhat about and how much of this consist of the produce of each of the four great department of industry affect by the Bill the cotton the silk the flax and the woollen manufacture Not less than from to This be a marvellously grave subject in legislation for any man to volunteer himself upon It be one that ought to be approach with the great possible calmness and circumspection because it be surround with interest of so enormous a magnitude that a false step might produce consequence which hereafter it would be find impossible to grapple with and because a step once take could not be retrace A man must have great confidence in his own power who would say It be a vast measure which touch no doubt of your trade almost the whole indeed of your foreign trade but I have so much confidence in my theory that I have no doubt whatever you may safely move in the direction I propose Men could see very clearly what be past they could see less clearly what be beside them but there be one direction in which they could not penetrate at all and that be the direction of the future It therefore behove a man to gather all the wisdom he could by look at the experience of the past and to fortify himself by all he could learn by look around him in the present before he set his foot forward in that dark and hidden region of the future into which mortal eye could not penetrate He Lord Brougham be not however one of those who say that on no account and in no circumstance should labour be interfere with so a to give protection to party who from their naturally helpless condition require it and he might be permit to observe that he do not object to limit the labour of very young child But even here there be difficulty and a to child under thirteen what have be the effect of our legislative limitation In the whole kingdom of Scotland number between two and three million of people no child under thirteen be allow to be employ in factory What have become of those child He grieve to say contemporaneous with their exclusion from the factory meeting after meeting have be hold in a great and important city he mean Glasgow which show they be there overwhelm with a numerous body of destitute child many of them orphan those unhappy child be in a state of destitution accompany a that condition ever would be with moral and religious degradation which make those interested in their welfare look back with deep regret upon the time when there be unrestricted employment for them in the factory There be however one point in which Parliament have do well and that be in the establishment of a narrow inspection upon the proceeding of He speak on this subject without any prejudice in favour of he have scarcely know more than half a dozen of them in his life highly estimable a a class though they be but he speak in favour of the workman and their child Previous to the time when the measure of the late Sir Peel be bring in it be not to be deny that there exist peculiar circumstance which require a remedy He have see romance describe them which at one time he think might be fairly accuse of exaggeration but on inquiry he find that the picture have not be draw in colour too horrid The only difference be that there be exaggeration in the picture produce by the poetical license be resort to of combine on one canvas all the varied feature of the evil a spread over a great number of locality but that each feature of which the picture be compose really do exist It be therefore right that a remedy should have then be apply and he now believe the factory be so improve in themselves and so well look after that no harm whatever result from the system but it be the great of all fallacy to say that because at one time we interfere to a limited extent in one particular direction and that we be compel to interfere therefore when the mischief have be remove we have a right at all future time to interfere in any direction and to any possible extent when there be no case of abuse when there be no cry enormity call for interference in the same way This desire for interference have give rise to every sort of absurd legislation and he would ask what be the nature of this measure It be a great mistake to call the Bill a Bill for diminish the number of hour labour of boy girl and woman only The fact be the Bill be nothing like what it profess to be It stop all labour at every mill employ in the four great staple manufacture of the country for more than ten hour a day It profess to stop the labour of adult woman but not that of the men but it do nevertheless stop the labour of adult men above ten hour just as much a if they be include in the Bill because it be impossible they could work unless the labour of the others be continue in short the Bill be just as much a Bill prohibit any person of any age and of either sex to work beyond ten hour a day a if it contain an expressly prohibitive clause to this effect adult woman above twenty be employ in factory and under twenty All these be to be take under the stepmother protection of the Legislature It be not contend that the mill could go on without their labour but a they be prohibit from work beyond ten hour the adult men who depend upon them would not be able to labour more than ten hour to say therefore that the Bill prevent only woman and young child from work more than ten hour be just as correct a if he be to prohibit a servant of his from go to Barnet or to the north of London in the first instance and then say Oh I do not prohibit him from go to York I only say he shall not go ten mile north of London Why if he be prevent from go the first ten mile how be he to get to York Just so if young people be to be prevent from work in the manufacture of cotton flax silk or woollen by which upwards of of work people be support such a measure would have the effect of likewise prevent the adult be employ Another point of great importance be that the limitation of labour to ten hour per day be a limitation of it to five day per week This indeed be not only the tendency but the avowed object of the Bill and he would ask what would be the consequence to those who accord to his noble Friend the Earl of Ellesmere profess themselves willing to adopt this somewhat extravagant step The first consequence would be a diminution of part of the trade for how could the same quantity of good continue to be manufacture unless mean be discover for make the whole amount of labour to be distribute over of the time That be to say six and a half million of our export besides a similar proportion for the home consumption in these great branch would be cut off and sweep away by the operation of the Bill It be enough if it be show that our whole manufacture would be diminish to conclude that the people who would most suffer would be the How would they suffer At once he reply by a diminution in their wage of which there would be an absolute necessity without the possibility of an escape An example of this might be show in the case of a manufacturer who employ workman in two mill drive by two steam engine One of the engine stop for necessary repair for one hour in the week and he be tell the wage of those sensibly felt the reduction which it cause A halfpenny or a penny per day be the mere trifle to any of their Lordships but the effect of sudden and temporary stoppage upon the factory operatives entail such a loss be really one of the most painful part of the subject The earnings of these poor person be always at the low possible point at which human nature could be sustain That be the necessary consequence of the general competition to which manufacturer be subject and the labourer be necessarily close cut to the quick a it be by every little stoppage to which they be subject But what be their Lordships go to do now to the factory he have mention They be go not to stop one of the steam engine for one hour in the week but they be to stop both the steam engine for twelve hour in the week They be go to prevent the people from work more than five day in the week at twelve hour a day or six day at ten hour a day it signify not which and the consequence might be conceive when accord to the statement of a respectable manufacturer the stoppage of half his steam power for one hour in the week be sensibly felt by his labourer a deprive them of some of their wage and consequently of some not of their comfort but of the necessary of life Now however their Lordships be to interfere to time the extent of the picture which he have be draw Then the would be all the bad off for this they take away of the master profit and in fact and this be the bad part of the whole story a great deal more It be accept a a fact that work a mill ten hour a day that be five day in the week be just sufficient to pay the expense of the establishment the wage of the workman and the cost of the good manufacture The entire profit make by work a mill be consequently derive in the other two hour or in the sixth day and the whole of his profit they would by this enactment completely sweep away If there be any doubt about this let inquiry be make it have not be deny elsewhere and it be assume on all occasion to be a correct calculation Would they not pause before they run the risk of do this If the profit of the master disappear what become of the men The master would not go on work without a profit and so the men would be disband the mill would be stop and see the mischief cause they would be compel to retrace the step they be now about to take as soon a ever they recover from the humanity fever under which for some year past we have be severely suffer Oh but say his noble Friend there be no difficulty at all The mill be already only work six hour a day Was it possible that his noble Friend come from a part of the country where the people be famed for their sagacity should not discover the inference which be to be draw from such an argument so make use of In other word it amount to this The people be half ruin they be struggle for existence the manufacturer be turn off men in Manchester and men in Nottingham in consequence of be utterly unable to give them employment The distress and misery thus produce be excessive And in such a state of thing what be the remedy propose His noble Friend propose what the sailor call to belay it to keep it a it be to prevent them from recover and to leave the people permanently in the desperate condition into which they have be plunge His noble Friend argument be just this we be in a state of temporary distress we can not work full time and when the distress of the moment pass away we shall be a badly off under the pressure of the law a we be now under the pressure of the famine His noble Friend have allude to the question of competition and have himself on use a new definition of that state of trade in call it barter It be barter between u and our customer but then there be another party tempt the same customer and this be the foreign competitor whose operation we be bind to consider before we interfere with our exist mean of carry on the competition His noble Friend who first address their Lordships have pass over this argument by express a sanguine hope that the foreign competitor would soon follow our example He Lord Brougham very much doubt if their Lordships would live to witness this result He too entertain a sanguine hope that sound principle would make progress among other nation with all the more speed if we first lead the way and give to such principle a practical development but he question if our neighbour the French whom he highly respect the Belgians the Dutch or even the Americans whom once also he have highly respect and whom he should again respect if his good opinion offer any inducement to that people when they cease to guide their action by the detestable doctrine that all America belong to the United States and that therefore the United States be privilege to make war and carry rapine into the territory of other nation and when they also discontinue make use of that singular invention of modern time repudiation but he doubt very much if these competitor would make any great haste to follow the example we wear about to set them Were the principle sound they might pursue the same path but in the first place they would see that the principle upon which we have base our legislation be altogether unsound Let him remind their Lordships of the effect of the abolition of the slave trade How many year pass before we be imitate Even to this day the Governments of some European country have not even step in the direction in which we have proceed It be say there might be a little national feeling on that question he do not deny it but would there be no national feeling here What temptation wear we not hold out to French commerce and what reason be we not give the French manufacturer for continue to work twelve hour and it might be for increase the ordinary time to fourteen hour We beat them now in every market though we have dearer labour and dearer live How By the amount of our capital by the perfection of our skill and by the exquisite machinery we employ to drive our trade by that skill and to make that capital produce it gain But if we now reduce the labour power of the country if we sacrifice part of the great staple branch of manufacture if we throw out of employment so largo a number of men do not their Lordships think these foreign competitor would be strongly tempt to say Oh now we see the mean of beat the English we begin to see how we can rival them we will keep our law a it be and their law will enable u to undersell them in every market in the world That indeed be a likely and a probable result and there be little reason to think our example our fatal example would ever be follow Their Lordships ought to remember that the workman would suffer if the mean of the manufacturer be reduce Some year ago Parliament pass a law permit the workman to combine for the prosecution of their common interest but let this enactment now before the House operate and the employed would he at the mercy of the employer and would no longer be in a position to with his the competition now be for work not for workman The manufacturer must of necessity maintain his present rate of profit for they be already reduce to the low possible amount in consequence of the competition with which he have to contend or give up business altogether Capital in the long run would overpower the labourer the person who have the capital would defeat the labourer and would throw the whole loss of upon the wage of the men whom he employ That he must do for the reason which he Lord Brougham have give if he do not in some way replace the loss of two hour he be enforce to endure he would be a ruined man If any one be romantic enough to suppose that the who last year clear would this year content himself with merely for the abstract benefit of the labourer if any one be so romantic a to entertain such a notion he be sure it be not his noble Friend who come from Yorkshire at all event or any noble Lord who be acquaint with Lancashire or the other manufacturing district But at the same time the deprive these poor people of a week of their labour would a he say before cut them to the quick Those who wear already reduce to the most scanty subsistence could not afford to lose of their mean of support and even grant that they would never want employment and on that they have no right to calculate still they leave them in a condition of permanent poverty The next consideration be what effect would this have upon the moral condition of these poor people He believe there be not a more sound principle he do not say of political economy but of social philosophy than this that poverty be the root of many evil that distress that uncertainty of possess the common necessary of life that the fear of want continually haunt the mind be just as injurious to the mental organization a it be to the physical health of a man To deprive a man have a year of would be do him little harm it would not at all interfere with his comfort and little with his luxury but to take away from the labourer the sum which such an enactment a this would take away would be to cut into not his comfort but the necessary of his existence There be nothing more certain than that whatever tend to relieve the mind from great anxiety and operate to keep a person in tolerably comfortable circumstance be the parent of right feeling and the parent of sound principle And if we now all of a sudden expose our labour population to the chance of poverty and all the care and anxiety by which poverty be accompany we must be prepare for the consequence which this would have upon the moral condition of the people Let noble Lords again take another view of the subject This Bill deal with factory per cent of the labour of the country be factory labour the remain per cent be not compose of factory workman and these workman the Bill profess not to touch But in point of fact this measure profess to leave them alone would interfere with them and would touch them most vitally It would drive those workman those with whom the Bill do directly deal and who would be prevent by the Bill from work twelve hour a day from their occupation If they restrict the opportunity of the factory workman and prevent him make the utmost possible profit of his industry energy and skill then naturally he would go out of the factory and become one of those labourer with whom legislation do not meddle and who do it so please them could work sixteen hour in the day Precisely therefore in the proportion in which the measure lower the wage of those employ in the manufacture would the factory operatives be drive into those branch of trade upon the operation of which no visible restriction be to be place This be a legislative premium give to those branch of trade at the expense of the manufacturer It would benefit the master by increase the number of hand but of course it would lower the wage in those trade not touch by the Bill There be however one argument urge by his noble Friend which seem most plausible His noble Friend say that the loss of the two hour would be amply compensate in the increased production to be speedily ensure by the introduction of more perfect machinery God forbid that anything should be do to cramp mechanical genius or to limit inventive power but still he could not help feeling that every increase of the power of machinery displace so much labour Would they then take legislative mean to increase the power of machinery and to displace labour to the extent of which he have speak And this would be the consequence undoubtedly of the measure What be the manufacturer to do He could only labour ten hour to produce the article for which twelve hour have before be require and nothing be leave him but to make machinery do the work upon which otherwise human hand would have be engage within the time permit by the law This be a view of the case which it be of the utmost importance should be carefully examine He have never put the matter to a workman or to a deputation from workman in this light without stagger them and without induce them to pause it be a view which have be carefully keep out of sight and which have never be refer to by those who have carry on an agitation in favour of the Bill The men be strike with the argument and on consideration they always admit that they be good where they be And the cause which would call for improved machinery would also have it effect upon the labourer he would have to work all the harder for have to work short time and thus whatever physical benefit he might have derive under other circumstance would be counterbalance and render nugatory He now come to a point which have be make prominent in the discussion of this question No person undervalue less than he do the importance and the good of education he have ere now make many effort to promote the education of the people and he would be the last man in this world to oppose himself to any measure calculate to advance that cause But if this Bill be frame to afford the opportunity of moral instruction and education to adults it do not go far enough and this the consistent advocate of legislation have acknowledge when they demand a restriction to eight hour Some of Her Majesty Ministers regardless of this objection have offer to split the difference between ten and twelve hour and to make it an Eleven Hours Bill Others with still more refinement make know that they would agree to a Bill for eleven and a half hour and one or two person have speak of eleven and a quarter hour and have recommend this idea in a way perhaps that do not greatly enhance the general respect for their ability or their wisdom If however moral instruction be their purpose and they decide upon violate every rule and infringing on every right of the labourer then in God name let them go about it in such a way a to attain their object Did any one think that by take two hour from the twelve they enable the labourer to improve his moral condition On the contrary they would allow him to work twelve hour in the day provide only that he work no more than hour in the week and remain idle on one day What would be the consequence The would not have time to read during the week but then it be say there be the Saturday Oh profound ignorance of the factory man of the factory nature and disposition It be suppose that when you allow them to work for twelve hour a day for five day of the week and give them a whole holiday on Saturday they would say not We have lose a day with the Roman Emperor but We have lose five day let u make up for it let u eschew the let u look on the a if it be not let u go to our home let u seek the pastor to commune with him let u send for the moral preacher and speak with him let u send right and leave to society and mechanic institute and the apprentice library for book let u take advantage of the various institution for the diffusion of useful knowledge have only this one day be Sunday we can not do it then let u devote this day to our moral improvement But then unhappily these people would be mulct of their wage all the while and with some that fact be a reason for thinking they would refrain from go to the But every one knew that the pressure of want and necessity induce men to indulge in intoxicate drink and it have be prove that class of men suffer great necessity and privation indulge in opium eating In Nottingham Yorkshire and Lancashire this practice be so common that person be in the habit of go about sell a preparation of opium No no Depriving the workman of of their wage would not prevent them from indulge in intoxication and intemperance He therefore could not help feeling that there would have be more sense in an Eight Hours Bill than one for ten hour the former could not have be a great offence against all principle and expediency and there would have be some little chance of it do some little good for suppose the men work the ten hour every day and do not take the Saturday a a day of leisure every one know a man after ten hour toil be too much fatigue to think of anything but rest and and above all he be most in want of tired nature sweet restorer balmy sleep He have be try to educate the peasantry for these forty year and his constant competitor and antagonist by which he have always be defeat be sleep The labourer always think that sleep be the best relief both for body and mind after a day labour who with some peculiarity be one of the best and kind men live and whose perseverance in this question be worthy of a good cause do not approve of an Eight Hour Bill it be too much too hazardous it would take off of the wage of the people and of the capital of the manufacturer at one blow but strike off of the wage be only less hazardous Now he believe there be very great delusion at the bottom of this question he believe the do not see it Unhappily he know pain have be take to mislead them They have be blind by very positive statement and assertion that there could be no diminution of wage or a very partial one Did the agitator go to them say I warn you that in agree to this you do it with the peril that wage will be diminish one sixth and do the generous workman the noble spinner or the romantic weaver say Be it so we be anxious for our moral improvement and have no objection to lose that one sixth of our earnings No they do not say that that the agitator keep in the dark they might not possibly object to lose or of their wage but they do not say they be ready to have take from them If they be so anxious for moral improvement a to be content to lose that amount they wear very different from the men who in one case he have mention already be tremblingly alive and nervously anxious a to the loss of or If the loss be fairly explain to them if they be fairly tell it would be no less than of their earnings he have no doubt they would retract their opinion He know the of the subjunctive mood be a difficult and perilous tense to speak in it be most difficult to say what might could would or should have happen if certain circumstance have happen that never happen But he venture to use this perilous tense now because he speak with the knowledge of a fact There exist in the West Riding of Yorkshire no more respectable man than he be a great manufacturer a wealthy capitalist and a more humane master or one more attentive to the want of his numerous workman he have never know or heard of He have four mill employ numerous people he hear of the anxiety among some of the men for short time and agree if the men resolve on it to begin work short time on a fixed day the large mill be against short time so be the second the other two be in favour of it It be try but not at the same wage and the moment the men discover that short time be give up by all the men He therefore venture to speak in this dangerous and difficult tense or rather in a safer and easy one for on experience of the past he assume what would happen if the plan should be adopt He have some other fact of the same sort with which he would not trouble the House He think therefore the authority of the workman themselves be slender on the present occasion leave the result of this experiment out of the question set aside the difference of opinion and take it entirely on it own merit if all the workman with one voice be for it he be bind a a lawgiver he be bind a a statesman to consider not what they wish not what they say they would have not what the agitator have get them to say they would have but what be good for them what be for their benefit and the benefit of the community and what they themselves would finally and deliberately wish and approve But then he be tell there be another authority on the question it be say the House of Commons have send up this Bill support by a very large majority Yet it be the very same House of Commons for there have be no general election that formerly reject the measure by a largo majority On the of March there be a majority of three the number be to against the Twelve Hours Clause It would naturally be suppose there would have be the same majority against the Ten Hours Clause he be sorry to say this be not the case on the next division there be in favour of a Ten Hours Clause and against it Thus the House of Commons would neither have a Twelve Hours nor a Ten Hours Bill The eleven hour party have not then come into existence What in the name of fortune would they have On the of May in the same year the Bill be bring forward again a precisely the same measure be it recollect some understanding appear to have be come to in the interval between the twelve hour and the ten hour party and the number upon the division be then to reject the Bill entirely by a clear working majority of Three short year only have then elapse since the same House of Commons from which the Bill have now come have reject it by the enormous majority of Then come the year in the month of May of which year a change seem to have come over the spirit of their dream for the Bill be again reject but by a majority of only The clear working majority of have dwindle down to what for distinction sake they might call the Whig majority of When he saw a phenomenon he like to trace it to it cause What be the cause of this sudden change The same cruelty the same hardships the same want of instruction exist in as in but it do happen that in the interval the corn law have be repeal It happen in the course of the severe contest which precede that repeal that the land men be range against the cotton and wool men the repeal be support chiefly by the cotton men and the spinner and be constantly abuse by the landed aristocracy The manufacturer have beat the land on the corn question the land say We will retaliate a little on mill and it do so happen that in connexion with this quarrel between the land and the mill the majority come down from to This year there have be a continuation of the same event of the same conversion the movement downward have be accelerate and the Bill come up to their Lordships now back by a large majority in it favour though two year only have elapse since an equally large majority be against it and all the circumstance of the case remain precisely the same He beg pardon of their Lordships for say the circumstance be the same circumstance be infinitely strong against the Bill now than ever they be before What time have these men take to change the opinion they have when the Bill would have do comparatively little mischief and convert the numerous vote they give against it to an immense majority in it favour When men be be throw out of employment by thousand and score of thousand when Providence have afflict them with a scarcity in England and an actual famine in Ireland when in every point of the compass to which they could turn their eye abroad and at home there be thick storm gathering and the heaven lower about them all around this be the time the House of Commons have choose to retrace it step and alter it vote from a majority of nearly against the measure to one of more than for it This be the crisis of all conceivable period in the history of the country when a prudent conscientious regard for the safety of the people and the best interest of the country above all for the best interest of the work people make it an imperative duty that they should show the utmost reluctance to change their commercial policy While they be menace with danger like these when the poor rate of a year be likely to increase to more when Ireland be suffer and bleed from every pore when they be oblige to send over supply of food and money to prevent the death of hunger from thin the land when the public peace be disturb when in one county within the last three day two hundred special constable have be swear in and the yeomanry call out to quell food riot this it seem be the time we be call on without experience upon speculation on assertion on assumption upon fantasy to pass a measure which must affect every work man in the country in the four great branch of it manufacture The promoter of the measure now before their Lordships desire to see it enact at the moment when of all others such a change seem to his mind the least desirable Most men must admit that if such an alteration be at all to be effect it ought not to be bring about when the people of this land be in the utmost extremity of distress Then in God name why not wait for the blessing of peace and tranquillity Do not fly in the face of Providence by such an experiment a that which it be propose to try through the present measure If they have no consideration for it direct effect upon the manufacture of the country let them at least consider for a moment it probable operation upon the landed interest Let it not for a moment be suppose that the present be not as much the case of the landlord a it be the case of the manufacturer Nothing could injure the one without deeply affect the other That great merchant and banker Child well say that land and trade be so knit together that together they must wax and wane nor could any ill happen to trade but land must suffer nor any ill to land without trade feel it With respect to the speech which their Lordships have already hear upon the Bill then before them he be bind in justice to both the noble Lords to render them his unfeigned thanks for the tone in which they have address the House He be bind injustice to them to say that he never have hear speech utter in a manner more cautious and measure he never in his life witness a more admirable shunning of every invidious topic there have not be one unfair or unjust allusion to the manufacturing class on the contrary every portion of the subject have be discuss with kindness and courtesy and therefore the remark which he make be not for them or any of their Lordships but for less wise men He would ask the supporter of the Bill then before the House do they or do any man in the country doubt that it effect must be to throw a large proportion of the people who work in factory upon the poor rate And who pay the poor rate Did not that burden in a great degree fall upon the land That the poor rate must be augment by the propose change and that the landed interest must therefore heavily suffer appear to him proposition almost He would say to the author and supporter of this measure do be lead away by any notion of benevolence benevolence to be practically useful must work good benevolence to be a fit principle of action for statesman and legislator must be combine with beneficence and before they hazard an experiment so bold so extensive so unlike anything that they have previously try they ought to consider most carefully how far they be likely to injure the class whose advantage they so earnestly seek to promote Moreover if they interfere with one class of labourer they ought to interpose in favour of all those who work out as well a those who work within door and there be none whose case be more deserving of commiseration than the agricultural labourer He doubt not that their feeling of benevolence have be most strongly excite by the exaggerated account which have reach them respect the the deplorable privation which those class be suppose to endure From every quarter they be tell of the hard toil which they undergo of their abode of their brief rest and continue hunger that the system by which they be govern render it impossible for them to be otherwise than hard fed and poorly lodge that they be therefore naturally prone to grasp at the least chance of improvement Hence the Legislature be call upon not to form it upon any principle of sound reason but to listen to the feeling which such statement be calculate to arouse The House therefore grasp at what be offer without carefully weigh what be it probable result No man could be more alive than he to the suffering which the factory labourer endure He felt as deeply a the most clamorous advocate of the measure how important it be that their interest should be well and carefully consider he felt the deep commiseration with the working class He know the hunger they suffer the toil they undergo he know the abode in which they live and all their misery meet his sympathy and wring his heart But his sympathy be not confine to those who work within door they reach without distinction the men who work abroad in the field as well a those who toil in factory The fatigue and misery that might be see in the peasant cottage quite equal if it do not surpass the wretchedness they be tell the factory labourer alone endure The peasant rise to his hard toil at five in the morning he snatch a hasty morsel which deserve not to be call a meal and during one brief he escape from the scorch sun or the pitiless rain to eat what no other man would consider a dinner Animal food he rarely taste and at the late hour he return to his squalid home drench either with rain or with perspiration He be bind to earn his scanty morsel not only with the sweat of his brow but by the most intense exertion of his whole muscular power without the support of sufficient food without the comfort of even a change of raiment and excepting in the northern county he be oblige to struggle through half the year ever wet and ever chill because without the comfort of fuel Hence his wretched clothes and his still more wretched bed be scarce ever dry The peasantry of England never know half the comfort that be to be find in the factory Hence the peasant who begin his course a an agricultural labourer at the age of fifteen or sixteen grow old before his time Yes he take it upon himself to say that such men scarcely ever reach the natural term of human existence But if it become so necessary to legislate thus stringently and against all principle for the men who toil in cotton factory why do the Bill stop there Why be not provision make for those whose life be shorten by work amongst filing of steel and those worker in brass who since the time of have be victim to their occupation Sir Samuel than whom a more humane man never exist could never be bring to support even the moderate measure introduce by the late Sir Peel in the year and why That most excellent and benevolent man be accustom to say Beware how you endeavour to find a substitute for parental feeling l parental feeling should resent the interference and become less pure should seek to render nugatory that which be attempt to be put in place of those affection without which it would be difficult to preserve the frame of society And this be say even against the moderate interference of protect very young child from the avarice of their parent What would the same benevolent and wise man have say of a Bill to confine all labour of all age and both sex compulsorily within give limit He could not conclude without apologize to their Lordships for have occupy so much of their attention and though it would be easy for him to address to the House many more argument against the measure then before them he hop he have lay sufficient ground to induce them favourably to receive that which he intend to move a an Amendment namely that the Bill then before them be read a second time that day six month The BISHOP of LONDON say that no one could be more sensible than he be of the great disadvantage under which he address the House when he rise to speak immediately after the noble and learned Lord who have just sit down He be the more especially affect by that consideration when he remember how deeply the noble Lord have study the question which the present Bill bring under discussion how often he have consider it hearing and how strongly he have permit his feeling to be excite by circumstance connect with that subject Reflections of that kind therefore lead him the Bishop of London to be most unwilling to address their Lordships at a moment like the present but he could not shrink from the imperative duty impose on him then to stand up in his place and declare his cordial assent to the Bill before the House He conceive that the working class would have great reason to be thankful for the measure which the House be now about to pass Their Lordships have hear many argument in favour of the measure but he could not help remind them that it be one which enlist in it favour the holy sympathy of our nature while the argument against the Bill be for the most part theoretical and drawn from principle which require to be modify by various practical consideration For surely the measure now before their Lordships be not one to be judge by the purely abstract principle of philosophy or science however true they might be in themselves it should be look at in connexion with the numberless anomaly result from the highly artificial state of society in which we live and it should be judge of by the preponderance of good or evil that be likely to result from it If all men be instruct in and prepare to obey the theoretical rule of political science then those abstract theory might be carry out but whilst they saw around them such a state of thing a at present exist whilst they be deal with misery with ignorance with wretchedness and vice they a legislator should be influence by charitable consideration towards those who have not a yet be emancipate from that specie of slavery they should bend and modify that rigid rule of theory to meet the exigency of the case It might be perfectly true a a general proposition that the competition for labour ought not to fetter with any restriction whatever but he would repeat that the assistance which abstract principle give to practical legislation be a specie of aid which have it limit The noble and learn Lord say that Parliament ought not to legislate upon subject which do not come properly within their scope and he call upon the House to refrain from such a course of legislation a would interfere with the freedom of the labour market which in a nation of great commercial enterprise ought not to be interfere with But he would take the liberty of tell the noble and learn Lord that Government best answer the purpose of it institution when it come near to paternal rule and when parent neglect parental duty the Government be bind to assume those function which the natural guardian of youth abandon or pervert And therefore he think that one of the most important duty of the Legislature be to interfere so a to prevent excessive injury from accrue to a large proportion of the population which be least able to protect and that where one portion of the subject be ignorant and powerless the law might interfere to prevent injury from be inflict upon a large class of those who might be otherwise left unprotected He could not help remark that throughout the whole of the speech which the House have just hear the question have be dealt with a one which solely concern the adult population But he think that a great part of the question concern that very numerous and unprotected class the child who be employ in factory and it be with reference to them particularly that he wish to ask for their Lordships attention to the observation he have to offer The factory workman act under the constraint of that necessity which be produce by the peculiar state of the labour market in the manufacturing district seem to regard their child a mere instrument for make money and here again he think the parental function of the State come into play and ought to interpose to relieve those child from that necessity If the cupidity of their employer or the ignorance of their parent compel them to extend their labour far beyond those limit of exertion which their bodily constitution be suit for and therefore he might say beyond that point which their benevolent Creator design for them he think it become the sacred duty of the Legislature to interfere and afford them that protection which their natural guardian be unable or unwilling to give them If they desire that the evil should not be perpetuate or aggravate and that some chance should be give to the rise generation of grow up in habit of religion and morality their Lordships must interpose to save them from their ceaseless round of exhaust toil and leave them more time for improvement Their intellectual faculty be contract by the monotonous and wearisome labour to which they be subject and that form no unimportant consideration in the question then before their Lordships The labourer notwithstanding the eloquent description of his noble and learn Friend of the effect which the toil of that labourer produce on his health and spirit be in a much more favourable condition for carry out the great object of his be than the factory workman His work be carry on in the open field where he be inhale pure air and saw the pure light of heaven and at any moment he might suspend his toil for a brief interval to prevent the exhaustion of his strength and spirit It be not so with the factory workman The mill must move on with unceasing motion for the appointed number of hour to complete the proper quantity of work and it admit of no intermission in the labour of those child who be depute to carry on and watch it ceaseless process Now that imprisonment a it be of a large class of our be a case in which the Legislature ought to interfere unless the evil which be work by it could be show to be less than those which would be produce by their interference The evil however of the present system be so great that they could hardly be contemplate by any humane man without shudder The debility of frame the shattered strength the exhaust spirit the early death be various and lamentable evil but they be not the bad Before however he proceed to the consideration of the latter point he would advert to the mortality of the manufacturing district It be prove that the process of factory labour do tend to shorten life in the manufacturing district It might be argue that the diminished average of human life in those district be to be ascribe to the unhealthy condition of large town but that be completely refute by certain fact which have be ascertain It appear from a statement which have be make by a most able and benevolent individual Fletcher a medical man who have make a close investigation of this subject that the average duration of life of the factory operative be somewhat less than that of other operative in the same district He would now advert to what he consider a the bad consequence of the present system namely that it entirely disqualify the child from receive the benefit of education after a certain age when perhaps it be not go too far to say education be more important to them than before He would admit that up to the age of year those child be comparatively well provide for a the hour of labour up to that age be limit to six hour but the moment they attain that age their work be double and they very soon lose all they have learn before because after twelve hour of exhaust labour they have no spirit or strength leave to attend school or to profit by it Their Lordships must also consider that in addition to those twelve hour for which they be oblige to work in the factory two more be reckon in go to and from the mill and in the necessary cleansing and refreshment so that even if this Bill pass and the hour of labour be restrict to ten hour there would be still twelve hour of the day no portion of which could be devote to school for the purpose of derive sound and wholesome instruction Under these circumstance it be no wonder that the clergy and medical men of the manufacturing district be all but unanimous in favour of this Bill which they believe would at least diminish if not altogether cure the evil that exist But the Bill be also support by a large portion of those whose interest would be most deeply affect by it not merely by factory workman but by many of the great who accord to the opinion of the opponent of the measure would be great loser by it It be say that they would lose of the factory labour of the country and to that extent our manufacture would be destroy But on the other side he place the great gain the measure would produce to morality and humanity He confess himself quite incompetent to judge of the ultimate bearing of the measure on the commerce of the country but he be very much encourage when he look back and saw what have result from the step they have already take in the same path of humane legislation They be tell when the Twelve Hours Bill be introduce that the same evil would result from it a be now predict of this measure but what have be the result of that Bill He be go to say that it be in a precisely opposite direction to what have be predict It appear from a statement make by a very intelligent person who be one of the most strenuous opponent of that Bill that the following effect have be produce on the wage of the factory labourer by the successive step take by the Legislature In the wage of woman in factory be a week in they be and in the mean time the price of food have become much low so that the change be all in favour of the His noble and learn Friend have say that in ten hour it would be impossible to produce a great a quantity of cotton manufacture a in twelve hour He admit that with the same mean only it would be so but his noble and learn Friend have himself take off much of the effect of his own argument by speaking of the improvement that might be make in machinery whereby labour might be diminish And again his noble and learn Friend speak of it be a certain effect of this Bill that it would drive from the mill a very considerable number of those who be now employ but who would no longer stay there when they find that good wage might be obtain in other part of the country but if that be so and any considerable emigration from the manufacturing district or mill do take place the consequence would be that there would remain a small number of workman and wage would rise in proportion He must be permit to think when his noble and learn Friend spoke of the delusion that have be practise upon the factory in this matter especially from the experience he have have whilst he be connect with that part of the country which be the chief seat of the cotton manufacture that those be a very intelligent and sagacious body of men alive to their own interest and not so easily deceive a his noble and learn Friend suppose and when he find so large a number of those person press their Lordships with great earnestness by petition to pass this Bill and say that they believe it would confer upon them the great possible boon even if it should be wrong he could not think it would be injurious to them to the extent which his noble and learn Friend suppose whilst they would have at least the satisfaction of have do the best in their by listen to the importunate prayer prefer to them He could not suppose that if the had have any suspicion that this measure would be so productive of ruin to themselves a his noble and learn Friend represent any of them would have advocate it nor would he believe that if they have entertain any reasonable suspicion that it would not only injure themselves but also that class who have be mental in produce their wealth they would have support it On the contrary he think that they have the best interest of their at heart He be ready to admit that all legislative interference be an evil and could only be justify so far a it prevent an evil of a great kind but the evil which be now seek to be remedied be of the most serious kind they be nothing less than the physical deterioration and moral degradation of a large portion of the most helpless class of the community Unless there be some improvement in the moral condition of those class the country would be throw into a situation of the great danger but that necessary moral and religious reformation never could be work unless they allow the young portion of those class to bestow a large part of their time on and learn that which would be useful to them in their future life With respect to the conclude argument of his noble and learn Friend for induce their Lordships to pause before they pass this Bill that the present be an unfavourable moment for make this experiment he the Bishop of London consider that no time could be more favourable If the factory be not fully employ and mill be do no more than ten hour work what evil could arise what chance be there of excite any angry feeling if they restrict them by law to that period of labour which practically they be limit to at the present time On the other hand he saw great danger in turn a deaf ear to the petition of so large a portion of their of that class too who be unhappily too often not restrain by motif which be the result of general religious instruction and moral education from give vent to their feeling and endeavour to accomplish their end by the most unlawful and dangerous mean He could conceive nothing more calculated to disquiet the mind of the manufacture population and make them unwilling to bear with patience and submission those privation which they be suffer at that moment and which he fear they must be prepare to suffer to a great extent still than the absence of a ready acquiescence on the part of their Lordships to those earnest petition which have be so long send up to their Lordships House pray for a more enlarged relaxation of the incessant and wearisome toil of the factory labourer which be injurious and hurtful not only to them but to their child who be to form the future manufacture population of this country For these reason he should give his most cordial assent to this Bill The DUKE of RICHMOND say that though his noble and learn Friend have state that the operative be not in favour of this Bill no less than have petition for it and he believe there be not a dozen who have petition against it The noble and learn Lord declare also that an agricultural labourer of be not so strong a one of their Lordships at but he could produce labourer in Sussex of the age of who would carry every one of their Lordships out of that House and when it be say that they labour from six in the morning till eight at night during harvest he must ask why they do so Because it be and so far from go home to meals the agricultural labourer sit on the sunny side of the hedge and eat his meat and drank good beer and would drink more of it if the malt tax be repeal Then the noble and learn Lord say that the agricultural labourer have no change of clothes Why where have the noble Lord be live Had he ever be within an agricultural labourer cottage He very much doubt it He wish that they be good off but if they be badly off be that any reason why they should allow hundred of thousand of other labourer to be destroy The right rev Prelate have so ably state the reason for this Bill that he would not enter into any detail but he trust their Lordships would not turn a deaf ear to the prayer of so large a portion of the operative No one in the country dislike the League more than he do but he know the value of agriculture commerce and manufacture go together one great cause of his oppose free trade be that it would limit manufacture and get rid of the home market and while he dislike the League he have a great respect and regard for the intelligent manufacturer and operative of this country The EARL of CLARENDON wish shortly to state the reason which would induce him to support the Amendment of his noble and learn Friend He should have be glad if he could have concur in the opinion which be express with so much eloquence by the noble Earl and by his noble Friend who move the second reading of the Bill if he could have support the Bill on the ground on which his noble Friend support it and have concur in his opinion and give him his support that it be for the benefit of the labouring class But on fully consider the subject and look to the best interest of these class he find himself call upon to support the Amendment of his noble and learn Friend for he believe that this measure be much more calculated to be hurtful to those for whose benefit it be intend than to be of any advantage to them and he be satisfy that if it pass it would inflict great evil on the operative engage in the by take from them of their labour for the operation of this Bill would extend much farther than his noble Friend intend It would extend not only to young child who be entitle to protection but to men and woman who be as well able a any of their Lordships to judge what be for their own interest and if they choose to work for any number of hour they please he do not see what business the Legislature have to interfere He be as anxious a the right rev Prelate to promote the social interest and religious improvement of the class of people to which he refer but he do not believe that this object would be obtain by deprive the work man of of the mean and they be not superabundant at any season of support his family This would be inevitable if the distribution of the produce of labour be to bear the same proportion which it do at present It be perfectly clear that in the present time of competition the profit of the manufacturer be not so great that they would bear reduction If they limit the number of hour during which the machinery might work they must a a consequence limit the quantity of produce This appear to him to be inevitable In go into the subject he would in the first instance call the attention of the House to what be the exist law and practice in the manufacturing district and what be the state of thing in former year The reason which be urge in former year for legislative interference with the factory no longer exist All those abuse to which so many allusion have be make have be get rid of They no longer heard of the cruelty of the master and of their compelling child to work sixteen hour a day Many improvement have be make through the instrumentality of the present law The exist law provide that child under year of age should work only six hour a day and that they should attend school for at least two hour a day Young person and woman be not allow to work for more than hour a week There be also a very important provision that no time should he make up for time lose by accident to the machinery At present the hour be thus distribute namely twelve hour for five day in the week and nine hour on Saturday The stoppage to the machinery in consequence of accident reduce the actual work to about eleven hour Again the be employ in comfortable place and not in such filthy place a have be describe by the right rev Prelate The workroom be airy and building and be much more healthy than those devote to other description of employment He believe this to be a fair and state of the case By the Bill however it be propose to reduce the hour of labour from to while holiday and other deduction such a the stoppage of the machinery through accident be to remain a they be The consequence of this would be the reduction of the period of labour for five day in the week from twelve hour to ten and nine hour on Saturday The effect of this state of thing would be to strike off of the fertile produce of the country for the produce would be in exact proportion to the period of the working of the machinery Of course this diminished proportion of produce would strike off of the wage of the operative His noble Friend who have move the second reading of the Bill do not argue that this would be the case It should be remember that wage form but a small component part of the cost of an article produce that there be the charge for the raw material then come the capital of the manufacturer sunk in the mill machinery and lastly come the wage of the labourer The diminished production which would ensue from the reduction of the hour of labour from twelve hour to ten would undoubtedly increase the price of the manufactured article As have be justly observe by his noble and learn Friend the same number of mill would not produce the same quantity of manufactured good a be now produce Fresh mill must therefore be build those who be wise men would build them abroad and men would build them at home We should have of our manufacture population more than we have at present dependent for employment and wage upon the production of a diminished quantity of manufacture and he for one could not look without alarm at such a state of thing He have no doubt that there be an honest belief that the increase of price in the manufactured article would permanently compensate the manufacturer for the diminished amount of production but he believe this to be an erroneous view of the case If however it be true that this increase of price would be permanent would it not be tantamount to impose on every labourer in the country a high price for his clothing solely for the benefit of those who work less and be pay more than others in a similar rank of life Such then be the direct consequence of this measure he would ask their Lordships to look also to the indirect consequence which would flow from it In the first place there would be less coal oil tallow leather and flour all of which be use to a great extent in manufacture consume than there use to be There would also be less flax silk woollen indigo madder and other dye use and there would be less ship employ All the trading interest in the country would suffer in proportion from this apparently humane measure for limit the hour of labour Then again their Lordships must remember that industry compete in certain district with the even now when the be work hour per week and when the come to work hour only per week the weaver would beat the and the manufacturer must come to Parliament and ask that the hour of labour of the weaver should be restrict also Such be some of the indirect effect of this measure although they be of little importance when view with reference to foreign competition If we be the only manufacturer in the world and possess a monopoly we should be enable to lay a tax on everybody by reduce the hour of labour But so far be we from have a monopoly that we have the great difficulty in compete with our numerous and formidable rival in the principal market of the world Our principal monopoly formerly consist of machinery but the exportation of that be now permit for our best workman be seduce from u by the high wage which be offer them from abroad and by permit the exportation we have now convert an inevitable loss into a certain gain The consequence however be that every manufacturer of machinery in Lancashire be busy with foreign order and all our improvement in machinery be immediately send to Belgium Italy Austria Russia and the United States At present Russia import lb of cotton yarn but last year she import a large quantity of raw cotton and we should ere long lose her market Switzerland now consume bale of cotton and all but the fine number of our yarn be exclude by her own cheap production France now spin bale of cotton and America which be our most formidable competitor have cheap cotton and unlimited water power completely beat u in low and stout cotton and not only supply her own consumption but export to China Canada and New Brunswick The present consumption of America be bale of raw cotton It should be remember also that all the continental nation as well a the United States work longer hour even than we do now and that this Bill would affect our staple article of manufacture which form of our export He ask then whether this be a matter which should be lightly or inconsiderately dealt with and against the wish of those whose capital give employment to the operative class Was this too a moment for try a rash experiment the result of which would be the same a if of the mill in England be burn to the ground He entirely agree with his noble and learn Friend in think that the operative whose wish the House be bind to consult do not desire this Bill with it consequence and that they do not apprehend that they would get only ten hour wage for ten hour work This be prove by the fact which be worth all the declamation on the subject that none of them have ask their master for ten hour work and ten hour wag The master who work short time and therefore give short wage find his hand leave him He consider that all these attempt at interference with labour and capital be unfounded and mischievous Why should they apply this principle solely to factory labour and why not carry it into every branch of industry where labour be employ Were their Lordships prepare to carry this law into every workshop and in the country Were they prepare to assent to a Bill compel their Lordships to give up of the time of their domestic servant because Parliament think that they ought to have more time for intellectual improvement He would ask the noble Duke on the opposite side whether he be prepare to pass such a law for agricultural labourer The DUKE of RICHMOND be understand to observe that half of the agricultural labourer die from excess of labour The EARL of CLARENDON say that his noble Friend have not answer his question whether he would like to have a law which would make it penal to employ labourer in harvest time more than nine hour a day and only eight on a Saturday He should like to know what the tenant farmer would say if a law be pass that he should not employ a labourer to work when he please and as long a he think proper He would beg their Lordships to remember that oscillation in trade must occur and that period must arrive when the operative would be oblige to work short time against their will and he would ask whether it be humane or justifiable to say that the operative should not earn wage in time of prosperity which would enable them to make some provision for disastrous period In the order of nature well season than the present would arrive and with them would come large demand for our manufacture from abroad but if this law be to limit the amount of production and increase price it would deprive our manufacturer of all mean of recover from period of depression The effect of the Bill be to put an income tax on the poor factory operatives not of per cent but of per cent with this difference that a deduction to that extent from his comfort be more injurious to him than a similar deduction from a rich man income He fully believe that all attempt on the part of Parliament to regulate capital and labour would fail and for these reason he must give his vote against the second reading of the Bill The BISHOP of OXFORD felt that he owe an apology to their Lordships for rise to address them at so late an hour but he have a pressing desire in his own mind to make some observation upon what have fall from his noble and learned Friend who have move the Amendment and also from the noble Earl who have just sit down and he should therefore state very briefly the simple ground on which he desire to give his vote in favour of the Motion of the noble Earl It seem to him that the opposition to this Bill be ground to a very remarkable degree upon a number of assertion It have be take for grant in the first place that they would be run a great risk of drive the British manufacture abroad in the next place that they be about to pass a law to which the factory labourer be themselves unwilling to assent while in the third place they be go to force upon the master manufacturer a measure which would deprive them of an adequate supply of labour to carry on their mill with profit Now what be the fact So far from the factory labourer be unwilling to accept this Bill more than of that very body have petition their Lordships to pass it and the same fact might be assert of the master manufacturer The noble Earl have suppose the case of a Minister impose an income tax upon their Lordships to increase their knowledge and improve their moral but be that case a parallel to the present Was it like the case of answer the prayer both of the workman and of the master manufacturer who alike call upon their Lordships to shelter them from the covetous desire of a few and whose endeavour be unavailing without the agency of their Lordships to introduce this great national good The noble Earl have argue that the wage of the labourer would fall in consequence of the time of labour be reduce But the question be not what be the portion of time deduct in the course of a single day but what be the amount of prohibition from labour for the year round He consider it to be only a prohibition against uncertain labour and that take the period of the last ten year it would be find though at some interval men be idle and at others they be overwork that upon the average the work actually perform be not more than ten hour a day What be the result It show that there exist a great desire on the part of the manufacturer to employ large body of men extra hour at uncertain period to meet sudden demand instead of be willing to share the market with others by employ men for limited hour thereby keep up a continued stroke of work and a continued average demand of labour But be it true that this deduction of time from the labour of the factory would amount to a loss of a state by the noble Earl It be a matter of calculation The first expense in a factory be the purchase of the raw material in the country where it be produce the next expense be the bring the raw material to this country then there be the interest of the money vest in the machinery then he have to pay for the labour in manufacture it and next the expense of export the good when manufacture Now the manufacturer reckon in this way Supposing that upon the whole capital lay out he make a profit of per cent he would appropriate it thus per cent upon his money per cent for wear and tear of machinery per cent for oil coal per cent for gas light make up altogether per cent Now it be only upon the per cent item that any possible increase of expense could be occasion to the manufacturer by this Bill because upon all the other item of per there must necessarily be a diminution of expense which would of course so far diminish his loss upon the per cent item that be to say the wear and tear of the machinery would be less the consumption of oil gas c would be less so that the actual amount of loss on the interest of the capital be not to be ascertain merely by consider the deduction from the hour of work This be a most important point in consider this question It have be assume in argument that if of the labourer work be take oft of his pay must also be deduct and the noble Earl have state that the have be altogether deceive upon this question and that they have be make to believe that they would be pay just the same amount of wage which they now receive although they work less time Now he the Bishop of Oxford have himself address the labourer upon this very subject and have urge the argument which the noble Earl have himself advanced and what be the answer which the people give him Why say they that be the argument of my Lord Brougham but there be nothing in it He the Bishop of Oxford do not say that there be nothing in the noble and learn Lord argument but at all event it show that there be nothing so very new in the proposition However to return to the work men answer That say they be Lord Brougham argument we have go thoroughly into it and we have come to this conclusion that our wage will probably sink by the reduction of of our work Reckoning three in a family earn a week each make a week for the whole family this amount might possibly he reduce by by this alteration This reduction they be prepare to stand the loss of and from the high motif for they declare that they could not hear to see a they now saw a young female who if the Legislature will it might grow up to be the healthy mother of a family waste in body and injure in moral by the overwork system that obtain for them a miserable addition of of what they otherwise would earn These men accordingly say that so far from act blindly and in the dark they rejoice to forego the But the great weight of the noble Earl argument appear to be direct to a point on which he seem to entertain very serious fear namely that this measure would encourage foreign manufacture and disturb the present commercial relation of the world The noble Earl have on this occasion somewhat yield to a fear of foreign competition to which in former day he be so magnanimously a stranger but to him the Bishop of Oxford it seem that the noble Earl have greatly misrepresent the risk that would be run The noble Earl state that of good be export annually and he argue that this measure would at once perforce inflict a loss of of that amount upon the trade of this country The noble Earl go far and say that the whole gain of the manufacturer be obtain in the last two hour of each day work and that if those two hour be take away the consequence would be that the British manufacture would be drive abroad That however be no new argument but it be altogether untrue Did their Lordships believe that all the wealth and power of the manufacturer of this empire be make up of a small fraction of a factory labourer day toil Could they for a moment conceive that by limit the labour of the factory worker to ten hour a day instead of twelve they would sweep away all the manufacture of the country and drive them abroad It seem to him that the humanity of the noble Earl be lead him astray Let their Lordships remember what those two last hour be Let them place themselves for a moment in those factory which the noble Earl have describe a be so comfortable and pure Let them remember that he be speak of young female who have to follow the rapid motion of the machinery of a mill it be a disputed point in the manufacturing district whether the time these poor female have to walk in the foetid atmosphere of those mill be twelve eighteen or mile a day Let their Lordships remember this and remember also the fixedness of the attention which be necessary for these young woman to maintain when walk in the midst of a factory where danger threaten them at every turn and where a single instance of negligence might be attend with loss of life or limb Let their Lordships consider all these thing and then let them say whether they will believe that the last two hour of that easy work in a comfortable warm room be the basis of that greatness of which the British manufacturer might so justly boast Could their Lordships believe that upon the last two hour labour of that tremble hand tend upon that machinery after long unceasing and attention when nature almost refuse to perform her function could their Lordships believe that upon those two last hour depend all the profit and accumulation of the manufacturer He believe that the work do in those two last hour be infinitely inferior in quality to that which be do in any other portion of the day It be demand work when nature refuse the power of work So far from this measure be a speculation the Marshall of Leeds have reduce their time of labour voluntarily to eleven hour a day Many other firm have do the same He have a return of the quantity of work do during five week when the mill be work twelve hour a day and also of the quantity of work do during five week when the mill be work only ten hour a day and it appear that during the five week at ten hour labour a day the master profit slightly exceed the profit of the five week labour at twelve hour a day But then the friend of this measure be tell that they be act rashly and upon the dictate of an unmeaning humanity But this measure be no new experiment Why their Lordships would remember that so long back a Sir Peel the father of the present right Baronet introduce a Bill for the purpose of limit the hour of labour and it be that Bill which form the foundation of the present measure That Bill have be argue sift and at length adopt from a grow conviction on the part of the manufacturer that it be a sound and wholesome measure Every master manufacturer be at first oppose to it now of them be for it For all these year this cause have be slowly win it way against the great of all human passion the love of gain and yet their Lordships be now tell not to act suddenly not to take a step which they would afterwards bitterly and hopelessly lament Many attempt have be already make of a similar kind Their Lordships would remember the Bill pass two year ago to prevent woman work in mine Every argument employ at the present time against this measure have be use then They be tell when the Bill to effect that improvement be bring in that it be the mad thing in the world to endeavour to settle by legislation the connexion between labour and wage They be tell that the person whose labour be to be affect would be reduce to starvation in consequence of the interference but they do not heed these anticipation they pass the measure and the result be that more work be do than before and in a good manner while the condition of the woman both in a moral and physical sense have be greatly ameliorate and in fact all the good which have be expect from the measure have be produce The principle of with labour have be give up in fact when it be agree that twelve hour be to be a limit and when the labour of child be regulate so that the objection could not be hold upon that principle This measure form no exception to the rule of political economy If indeed they attempt by legislation to regulate the wage of labour it would be an infraction of the principle of political economy but by this measure they do not make any such proposition they merely say it be wrong to create wealth by the sacrifice of the health and moral of a portion of the people that wealth so obtain be unlawfully obtain and that any nation which sanction such a mode of obtain wealth could not prosper Such a statement could not be say to be oppose to the principle of political economy and it might as well be say that it be oppose to political economy to abstain from work on Sundays There be no doubt that it would be more profitable to work seven day than six but would it be right to do so The folly of legislation be needless interference the wisdom of legislation be necessary interference where it be demand by the moral and physical condition of the people They do not say to a man that he would be allow to build a house in any manner he please even on his private property without regard to the interest and right of society No but they say that he should not interfere with the rational liberty of others and that he should not build an unsafe house or one which would be dangerous to the public It be the duty of the Legislature to do a it be propose to do by this Bill namely to protect those who could not safely protect themselves From what be they to protect them From be force to work to such an extent that the interest of society would be sacrifice by that labour He do not speak of the danger of allow people to remain with sorrowing and sadden heart under suffering which they have bear with such exemplary patience and thus drive them to take the law into their own hand He do not speak of that danger although he believe there be nothing more dangerous than for the representative of a great people to leave one of their just desire unsatisfied and to put off the remedy with cold negation or needless delay The employer of labour have it in their power to remove the objection which now exist but if the Legislature do not interfere in this case how could the people proceed to obtain a remedy Only by combination Were their Lordships then to show to the people that their only mode of obtain redress be by combination amongst themselves He have speak to them upon this subject and they tell him that in the combination which have be enter into on the subject of adult labour great difficulty be find in prevent unlawful proceeding from be mix up with their undertaking and that form a great objection to any combination in order to provide a remedy for the evil of the present hour If they be drive to for redress it would in his opinion be productive of one of the great danger which could exist He beseech their Lordships therefore not to deprive them of this relief he beseech them not to refuse them redress from any fear that it would diminish our manufacturing productiveness or drive our manufacturer to foreign country What give u this great and magnificent superiority in manufacture which we possess In the first place the security of all property which be invest in manufacture in England and next the wonderful industry power and patience of the person who work our machinery See then what we be do If we be bring up in our manufacturing district a vast population who be altogether stranger to the high motif of moral conduct it be surely scarcely consistent with the security of this great nation and so far a regard the maintenance of our manufacture nothing be so likely to drive our manufacturer abroad a to feel that in this country they be not safe from the violence of an untaught and ungovernable populace He beseech their Lordships to consider that by do anything which tend to the physical deterioration of the people they be diminish the strength of the right arm of the country Let them think a they might this world be govern on moral principle and retribution would surely come They might depend upon it that what be politically wrong could not be politically expedient there could be no trifle with moral principle and in the long run they might depend upon it that by some of those numerous channel which regulate productive labour the Government would discover that if they neglect the people welfare to make the nation rich they would make the nation poor in debase the people LORD who be very imperfectly hear say their Lordships be not now to debate the principle of interference with labour that have be introduce so long ago a and in in and again in that question have be raise and decide The state of society require such interference in particular case and the circumstance under which some portion of the labour population be compel to sell their labour exempt them from the ordinary rule It be a mockery to talk of the freedom of the labourer there be in fact no market After all the which this subject have undergone what have be the effect produce upon the public mind Why the result have be most favourable to this measure for to the number of petition in favour of the Bill there have be signature and only about against it He contend that by require female to be at work for fourteen hour include the two hour for meal they be exact more labour from them than be take from the men employ in almost any other department of industry in the country He believe that among a great mass of the people of this country there be a grow conviction that some interference be necessary to protect the moral and religious interest of the work people and he hop therefore that their Lordships would consent to the passing of the present Bill The BISHOP of DAVID felt it his duty to say a few word on this question though he do so with reluctance because what he do say might have a tendency to weaken the impression their Lordships have receive from the most eloquent and effective address of the right rev Prelate who have already deliver his sentiment Nevertheless the subject be one of such great importance that he crave their indulgence for a few minute while he give the reason which notwithstanding all that have be say on the opposite side would induce him to vote for the Motion of the noble Earl He agree with the noble and learn Lord Lord Brougham that the physical comfort and welfare of the working class be the most essential of all consideration and ought to be especially attend to by their Lordships because they be the basis of every other benefit which could be confer upon them and be necessary to their receiving other and high degree of improvement The noble and learn Lord however have fail to prove that the limitation of the hour of labour propose in the Bill would be injurious to the physical comfort of the people The noble and learn Lord have admit that there be case in which it be the duty of the Legislature to interfere for the protection of the labouring portion of their subject and he think that this be clearly one of the case in which such interference be justified It be a question on which they could not plead want of information for the Legislature have the full mean of obtain all the information that be requisite to form a He agree with the noble and learn Lord that the principle of political economy be the principle of common sense and he should like to know in what particular the propose measure if enact would infringe on the principle either of political economy or common sense Instead of that instead of be a constraint upon the right of freedom he appeal to past experience whether or not in too many instance the employer in this country have not abuse the power they possess and therefore instead of the present Bill be an interference with labour it would constitute a wholesome restraint against the abuse of power it be substitute a system of restraint for a pernicious system of coercion There be he believe no view of the subject take up by the noble and learn Lord which have not be present to the mind of the work men of this country They have fully consider the question they have the mean of form an enlighten on that question and in the conclusion they have come to he believe they be more likely to be right than those with whom they differ a no other person whatever might be their station could have the same advantage in fully consider the subject They have be tell that the most disastrous consequence be likely to arise from the adoption of this measure and much stress have be lay on the injury it would create to the comfort and welfare of the work men and the reduction of wage which would be occasion But the working men themselves do not entertain these opinion and they express their belief that the statement of the noble and learn Lord on this part of the subject be greatly exaggerated He find then on the one hand that there be objection to the Bill deny by those who know best their real force the work men themselves and on the other hand there be the interest and of the working class the necessity of support which be acknowledge and admit by all He entreat their Lordships then not to be carry away by the idea that if they adopt this measure they be make a perilous experiment He maintain that the peril be all on that side on which the evil be now manifest and that by adopt the present measure they be take the safe and wise course and that which to all appearance be calculate to give the great benefit to the great number of their follow creature LORD consider that in a case in which the interest of humanity and benevolence be deeply involved it be but natural that the right rev Bench should be interested in it but they ought to make it clear that the cause they espouse be one of humanity and their Lordships be bind to consider whether in carry out that principle of humanity the manufacture of the country would survive the operation The great objection which he entertain to now give his vote in favour of this measure be found on the fact that they be proceed to legislate with but imperfect information He deny that generally the operative would be find to be in support of the Bill and even grant that such be the case he doubt if the operative be not guide too much by his wish and hope and too little by his The master manufacturer be in a position to discern with far great clearness the probable effect of such a restriction upon labour both upon himself and upon those he employ and while he remind their Lordships that the majority of the be oppose to the Bill he admit that the number of those who have declare an opinion in it favour offer a strong reason why those practically unfamiliar with the question should now lean to the side of that which be suppose to be humanity If he have see any disposition on the part of their Lordships to reconsider the subject in Committee and then agree to an Eleven Hours Bill he should have vote for the second reading on this occasion but a there be no ground for such a supposition he felt himself call upon to support the Amendment of his noble and learn Friend"

foundation SIR GEORGE GREY In answer to the question of the Member I have to say that I have receive no communication private or official from the Mayor of Birmingham relative to the allege erection now in progress within the borough of a large convent trust the House would allow him to answer at least part of the statement of the Member for Birmingham He in the first place must deny that he have any hostility to Roman Catholics individually though he be not ashamed to avow that he felt great hostility towards the principle of the Roman Catholic religion and with respect to what he say on a former occasion he admit it be fairly open to the construction which have be put upon it But when the Member for Birmingham say there be no foundation for say there be cell in the convent he could

on this The house allude to in this extract be one which I be build for the congregation of the oratory of Philip of which I be superior I myself be under no other superior elsewhere The underground cell to which refers have be devise in order to economise space for office commonly attach to a large house Newman allude to the cell He admit their existence Oh oh Let Members not cry out too soon

perhaps wine may occupy a third As to the rest ought to know that we have have idea of baking and brewing but I can not pledge myself to him that such will be their ultimate destination Larger subterraneans commonly run under gentleman house in London but I have never in thought or word connect them with practice of cruelty and with inquest and never ask their owner what use they make of them Where be this inquisition into the private matter of Catholics to end He would ask any Gentlemen of common sense if ever they know of bake brewing and washing to be carry on in the country in cell underground But he have more to say upon this subject Knowing that he be to be challenge in that House he write to a gentleman in Birmingham who live close by the place and request him to call upon a builder who he know have go over the building while it be in the course of erection and he have receive from him the follow reply Oh oh He could very well understand why some Gentleman do not

but my informant say that the number of them preclude the supposition of this be the object of their construction I ask him if the object of the construction of these cell might be to strengthen the foundation He reply not or they would not have be make so high much less than foot would have be sufficient for that purpose Why be they fit up with fireplace He have see a gentleman who have visit the building who tell him one of the compartment be large than the rest and be evidently to be cover in without the building over it He be tell it be for a laundry and he ask what use be a laundry in

17567	"CLASS I._1889"	"Northampton I beg to move the reduction of the Tote by the sum of I have frequently object to this Vote and I will explain why When the Civil List be arrange these establishment be set apart for Her Majesty use but now we find that they be inhabit by a few private individual who therefore derive very considerable benefit I do not want to make this a personal matter but they be give away and give away generally to people of no very great eminence We have not only give the house but we be call upon every year to spend large sum upon their maintenance I contend that the least these people should be require to do be what we have to do when we take a house on lease namely to keep the house in repair I will give two instance I see that upon the Hampton Court Stud House be spend on maintenance and repair and for furniture it appear we have also to provide furniture The Committee will see that be spend last year As a mere matter of speculation I would take the house gratis and willingly keep it in repair It be a house situate near London and anyone would be willing to keep it in repair for the pleasure of living in it Then again in respect of Palace and building have be spend on maintenance and repair for furniture and for fuel lighting in all Last year we spend upon this establishment The peculiarity of this house at be that no one live in it except perhaps a servant and a cat or two I really think this expenditure ought to stop We ought to pull down the house if we can do nothing with it and thus save this expenditure There be in addition Hawthorn Cottage House and all the others We ought either to sell them or pull them down or let them or if we do neither of these thing at least when these house be give away we ought not to be call upon to pay for their repair FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS Dublin University The Gentleman have refer in particular to two house namely the Hampton Court Stud House and Palace and therefore I need not go into the particular concern the other house I only give them a example I understand he only mention them a illustration His suggestion be that these house ought to be pull down or sell or else the people inhabit them should be require to pay for their maintenance and repair In the first place I wish to explain to the Committee what it be exactly we do We have nothing to do with the furnishing of these house or with any expense except the bare maintenance of the structure we have to see that the structure be in proper repair I think I can satisfy the Committee in a very short time that this be really a matter in which we have no option whatever These house be what may be call the Royal house of the Sovereign Her Majesty have the right either to occupy them herself at any time or to give leave to certain person to inhabit them and that have always be in the power of the Sovereign Up to the accession of William in these expense be defray out of the Civil List which be vote to the Sovereign for this and other purpose The Committee will remember that prior to there have be an agitation in favour of transfer certain charge payable on the Civil List to the Estimates That agitation be lead by Brougham and be continue for some time On the accession of William IV an opportunity arose for a revision or me Civil List A very strong Committee be appoint by the House It go very fully into the charge on the Civil List during the reign and make various recommendation Amongst those recommendation be one to the effect that such charge a those now under consideration which have theretofore be part of the expense of the Board or Office of Works and a such defray out of the Civil List should be transfer to the Estimates That suggestion be adopt by the Parliament of that time On the other hand follow up the recommendation of that Committee the Civil List be considerably reduce reduce by almost The arrangement be reconsider on the accession of Her present Gracious Majesty The Committee appoint on that occasion be again a very strong one consisting a it do amongst others of Lord John Russell Sir Robert Peel Hume and They take into their consideration the arrangement which have be make in and they report that the arrangement then make have be entirely satisfactory have lead to economy and should be renew The arrangement be renew and therefore so far a my office be concern all these Royal Houses be include amongst the other public building and palaces the expense of maintain and repair which be to be provide for in the Estimates In fact Parliament act on the Report of a Committee of this House think fit to reduce very largely the Civil List out of which the repair of these Royal Palaces have be defray in consideration of which Parliament undertook that these expense should in future be throw on the Votes GARDNER Saffron Walden Essex I understand the right Gentleman to say in regard to the palace not in the occupation of the Sovereign no money be to be charge for furniture I find in the Estimates for Kensington Palace a charge of that kind of in those for Hampton Court Palace a charge for and for Palace make a total of over Therefore I should like to have an explanation of the statement of the right Gentleman It seem to me that in justify any extravagance which be point out those who defend it on the part of the Government be like the doctor who when they can show how a disease originate be as proud a though they have cure it In the history of this country and in the gradual modification of it Constitution many abuse have grow up some of which though trivial in themselves be very irritate to the popular mind I be exceedingly sorry that the Treasury Bench be not alive to the importance of secure on a firm foundation a rational attachment to the Throne It must be well know to Members who have come into general contact with their own constituent not of one party alone but of all that those who be new to political life be most sensitive in regard to charge for the maintenance of the Royal establishment I can give an illustration of this from my own experience Having occasion to address my own constituent on the work of the House during the past year I have to refer to the various way in which the national money be spend and I remember that a very innocent illustration I use lead to a perfect storm of disapprobation with regard to the money vote for the Royal establishment In come away from the meeting I be overtake by one of the audience a plain work man to whom I say in reply to the objection he have urge Really I be shocked I do not know that you be such Republicans down here Ah say he but we be But I rejoin surely you do not object to pay the hereditary President of your Commonwealth Well reply the man we be content to leave that to you But he would not hear of any other Royal endowment That be an illustration of what be think of the little extravagance which we regard a so trivial but which seem so greatly to irritate the mind of the people on whom the future of the country will depend and I say that unless mean be take to obviate these objection within an easily measurable distance of time some future Government will find itself in difficulty it will be almost impossible to surmount without a very grave change With regard to the Royal Palaces I will only take those in the occupation of Her Majesty and Marlborough House for which we be call on to expend and this I will compare with the sum charge for the Science and Art Department building and British Museum building namely Now it will be make a matter of complaint in the country that while we only spend for Science and Art building we be call on to expend on our Royal Palaces many of which be absolutely useless to Royalty The people will think that their representative do not pay sufficient attention to their interest If their anger be direct only against their representative it would be of little consequence but it may be direct elsewhere against the Constitution of the country They fret and fume against the tradition under which we have live and unless some change be make a dangerous temper may spring up Therefore I most heartily support the Amendment of my Friend Montgomery I wish to ask the right Gentleman the First Commissioner of Works by whom we be meet with the statement that we have not the power of alter certain thing in relation to this Vote whether he will tell u what it be we have the power to alter Northampton At the commencement of nearly every Session we hear a statement a to the bargain that have be make at the beginning of each reign which shock my sentiment of historic accuracy the right Gentleman have be more specific but I think there have be some variation from or misconception with reference to the fact in connection with this matter I understand the right Gentleman to say that at the commencement of the reign of William the Fourth a large reduction be make in the Civil List and that that reduction be still further continue at the commencement of the present reign If the right Gentleman mean that sum which use to be contain in the Civil List be take out of it and that a nominal reduction be make by so do I be ready to agree with him but if he mean that any real saving have thereby be effect to the country I take leave to suggest that he have entirely misapprehend the fact because at the present moment the total of the amount vote on account of the Royal Family or charge on the Consolidated Fund be large than the whole Civil List of William IV at the commencement of his reign although that include a large number of item which either fall now on the Consolidated Fund or be vote in the Estimates I do not think the right Gentleman do justice to himself or the Committee when he use the word reduce instead of increase The truth be that the cost of Royalty have be continually increase in this country The objection have always be that it be not fair to the country that Estimates should be so brought forward especially at a time when owe largely to the effort of the noble Lord the Member for Paddington Lord Churchill so great an improvement be be make in those for the Army and Navy a to leave the public in the dark with regard to those that be present in respect to the Civil Service Moreover it be a matter of complaint when you lead them to believe that these Estimates be less than they be before whereas a large sum be now pay than be ever know since with a slight exception during the extravagant reign of George III I be prepared by figure to prove that you be wrong in say that the cost of Royalty be reduce The only reason for my not now go fully into the matter be that I remember on a previous occasion I be prevent from discuss the subject of the gross cost of the Royal Family on this Vote I should not have allude to it now only that the word reduce come upon me a a shock to my reason and I felt bound to protest against it It be not in point of figure true that there have be any reduction at all except a very nominal reduction by take item out of the Civil List or put them on to the Votes or the Consolidated Fund but the actual cost be heavy now than it ever be before possibly for reason quite independent of this Vote now under discussion The cost of Royalty be large now than when these sum be include in the Civil List I do not follow the Member into a discussion which a the Member himself have suggest be perhaps hardly germane to the Vote now before the Committee With regard to these Palaces there have be a considerable reduction in the expenditure upon them So far a the Member refers to the removal of certain other item not include in this Vote from the Civil List I be not prepared with the material to go into that part of the subject but so far a this Vote be concern I can confidently say that several thousand of pound have be save by this operation I think that be an answer also to my Friend opposite who ask whether Parliament have any control over these matter Parliament clearly have control over those matter so far a the economical administration of the work agree to be do be concern An Member ask what be the meaning of the charge for furniture at Hampton Court Kensington and James There be no expense for furnish the room in those Palaces for grace and favour occupant The cost for furniture be mainly in connection with picture and tapestry at Hampton in the case of St James for the State Rooms which be use for public function and in the instance of Kensington Palace the cost be incur for the room of an official employed to look after the entire building SWINBURNE Staffordshire Lichfield I should like the right Gentleman to consider what be the evidence with regard to Palace Looking at it from a practical point of view we spend a year on the Palace which be empty and have never be occupy for upwards of year and which the Government have no power to let or to sell or make any use of be prevent by a bargain which they make fifty or sixty year ago I think no good will come of this Palace which cost u a year until Parliament refuse to vote the money and the sooner we come to that point the good It be perfectly monstrous to go on spending upon a building which the Government be unable to sell but must keep in repair If we turn to the total amount spend on Palaces not in the occupation of Her Majesty we find that it be I do hope that either by the Government bringing in a Bill or by some other mean an effort will be make to render useful that which be now useless JAMES East Finsbury Courtney I support the Amendment of my Friend not because I think of the mere temporary reduction which be move but because I think the time have come when an entirely new departure should be make with regard to these building If they can be devote to the good of the whole community then I be prepared to support any proposition for their be utilize in this manner but if they can not be so utilized but must be use a ward for a specie of indoor relief for certain person of the upper grade of society then I think we ought to refuse to vote the money for the maintenance of the structure for under such circumstance the sooner they fall to piece the good for the community I have be look at some of the figure and it be surprise what an amount it take every year to keep these building in repair I do not know exactly what they be build of but it seem a wonderful thing that in some instance we should have have to vote and a year for structural alteration for we have it from the First Commissioner of Works that none of the money be apply to make the occupant of the building comfortable by purchase furniture and so forth My only object in rise be to urge upon the Government the necessity of bring what might have be suit to the requirement of year ago into accordance with the wish of the people at the present time and the sooner the Government entirely remedy this system of have Palaces not occupy by Royalty but by person nominate by Royalty the good it will be for the country GEORGE Glasgow I think the Member who have just speak have put the case admirably The great palace occupy by Her Majesty undoubtedly ought to be keep up and keep up well by the nation But it be another matter altogether when we come to those house which be give for occupation by favour In Hampton Court a considerable number of the dwelling go to men and the relation of men who have serve the country both in their military capacity and a civilian To those I have no objection at all but in a very large number of instance these room be give to person who have no claim upon the country whatever and in fact in some case to less than a claim upon the country because of the early part of their own career or by their relative have receive public money and do very little for it Now if Her Majesty graciously give these lodging to person I must say that I do not see why the nation should give anything more than the bare house If we look at the Vote we find that the reduction of be contain very well within the class of expense which fall upon all who live in their own house and which ought to fall upon those fortunate people who live in house rent free and not up in the country I hope the Government will be encourage to make an examination of this subject and recommend that these house should be give only to person who deserve well of the country and I must say that when they have those public lodge house they should then be in the same position a people who have house in the country and should themselves maintain the building In vote for the reduction I do not wish it to be understood that we ought to keep up the Palaces which Her Majesty occupy during her lifetime and long may that last MUNRO FERGUSON It be difficult to recognize Buckingham Palace under the name of the great Reception House of the Nation and it might very properly be call the deserted Palace and Gardens I would venture to point out that the cost of maintenance of the Palaces not occupy by Her Majesty be large than the cost incur for the Palaces which Her Majesty occupy The room which be occupy at Hampton by the favour of the Sovereign be not altogether advantageous because last year the whole Palace be nearly lose by a fire have arise in one of the room so lent I almost wish a a matter of fact that we have never have any ancestor at all for a more stupid set of people never exist If there be ever any permanent folly it be our ancestor who have pledge u to it But I be not go to accept post obit draw upon me by my ancestor When a Vote be on the Estimates we claim the right to discuss it or why be it submit to this House We be ask to vote the money and that implies necessarily that we may decline to vote it The right Gentleman have not tell me who live in Palace I believe as far a ever I have be able to gather nobody do live there It cost u a year Her Majesty have be on the Throne year so that the Palace have cost u during her reign I have mention Hampton Court Stud House That have be give to a gentleman who be highly respectable but in no way eminent for his service to the country Take the year that that gentleman and his predecessor have occupy it and it will be find that the House have cost u Is it not time that a stop should be put to this sort of thing Putting aside the question of the original bargain I say there be not the slight doubt that if this House be to refuse to grant money in future for the repair of this building Her Majesty would assent to the fair and reasonable condition that the tenant should maintain the repair in the future I be not ask that the house should be pull down what I submit be that it should not cost u anything for repair Before we part with this Vote I would ask the right Gentleman a question about Hampton Court I sometimes go there when I be incline to look at Sir Peter picture of Charles the Second lady I find there be generally a crowd there try to see them Now there be some railing stretch across the room where the picture be so that you can not get to see them properly I inquire why the railing be there and be tell it be because of a bed which be the bed of the legitimate spouse of George the Third Perhaps I ought to admire this bed more than I do the lady but there be nothing artistic in the bed and I hope the right Gentleman will order the apparatus to be take away and thus give the public an opportunity of see the picture of Sir Peter The Secretary to the Treasury promise that the Government would consider whether it be possible to issue with the estimate an additional memorandum show the total item include the Civil List and the charge on the Consolidated Fund in connection with the Royal Family Have the Government consider that point and why be there no such memorandum As to the existence of any such undertaking I can not answer in the absence of my Friend the Secretary to the Treasury I have no knowledge of it but I will consult with him and communicate the result to the Member opposite As regard the railing round Sir Peter picture I will imitate the example of the Member and study the geography of the room and if I find they be a source of inconvenience to myself I will see whether anything can be do to remedy it NORRIS Tower Hamlets The question before the Committee have be so amply discuss by many Members opposite it may perhaps be of some advantage to know the view which be take by myself and those sit near me and although on some ground I might have support the Amendment yet on those advance by the Member I be unable to do so With regard to the royal Palaces which be necessary for the use of Her Majesty and the Royal Family I think it be incumbent on the nation to contribute most liberally to their maintenance But in regard to Palace I think there be some cause for complaint I believe this Palace be of no earthly use to anybody and it do appear to me that if we vote per annum towards that edifice it should be devote to the use of the public in some form or other I heartily concur therefore in the suggestion that the time have come when there should be some inquiry into this matter and although I shall not vote for the Amendment for the reason that I do not concur in the form in which it have be bring forward I wish it to be understood that have the Member make it refer directly to the Vote for Palace I should have go into the Lobby with him HANDEL Bristol Ever since I have be in Parliament when these matter have be discuss the historical argument have always be advance whenever it be propose to make additional grant to Members of the Royal Family although we never hear of it when there be anything to be do in the way of reduction If Members of this House wish a I do to see loyalty more rife in this country they must avoid such irritating circumstance a the have a number of palace unused keep up at the expense of the nation We have a large amount of poverty in this country and we be not justify in spend the people money in the maintenance of palace unless they may be use for the public benefit On the Continent the palace be open to the public and I claim that English palace should be open to our public SIR GEORGE CAMPBELL I wish to say a word on the subject of Palace which I believe be one of the most gloomy and most useless palace ever heard of Gardens on the other hand be a very popular resort but unfortunately the people who go there be allow to have no refreshment in the Gardens nor be they allow to scatter sandwich paper about I suggest that the Palace might be convert into a refreshment and lounge palace for the British public and I think you would thereby be make most excellent use of the building Cornwall We have be assure by the right Gentleman that the nation be only bound to maintain the fabric of the Royal palace and that we have nothing to do with the internal arrangement If that be so I wish to know how come it that we find in this Estimate item relate to salary wage and allowance in connection say with Buckingham Palace Windsor Castle and Kensington Palace As far a Kensington Palace be concern I do not believe that I have ever be able to gain admission there because the whole of it be practically devote to the Royal and aristocratic lodger to whom it be give up I think we have a right to demand to know exactly why these item be charge against u For instance there be for insurance tithe charge fire household expense a charge of for Windsor Castle and for Hampton Court Palace and there be nothing to show exactly how these sum be make up I think that the lady and gentleman whom the Queen allow to occupy the public palace ought to pay for their own fuel light water and household article and I see no reason too why they should not pay for insurance and tithe rent charge Again I should like to know how many of these palace be in existence at the time the historical bargain be enter into With regard to the fire at Hampton Court Palace I see there be a considerable charge for restoration of part of the building Now I be not go to object THE CHAIRMAN Order order That point do not arise out of this Estimate I may have be mistake Sir but I be under the impression it do I will not of course after your ruling refer to it far I only wish now to ask the right Gentleman to explain the matter to which I have draw attention I endorse entirely what have be say by my Friend a to the injurious effect upon the popularity of the Royal Family which be produce in the public mind by the taxpayer be call upon constantly to pay large sum of money for their benefit and for the maintenance of palace which be not occupy by the Royal Family Of course I can not object to this feeling because I think it tend to the gradual introduction into the British mind of the appreciation of the superiority of Republican over Monarchical institution but I would suggest that those who support the present regime should do all that be in their power to secure the removal of these item from the Estimates and the abolition consequently of these cause of complaint NOLAN Louth I intend Sir to support the Amendment of my Friend mainly on the ground that there be no explanation of several of the large item which appear in the Estimates I wish to know too under what circumstance the repair be carry out at these Royal palace Is the work hand over to private firm or be tender invite and the contract give to the low tenderer I fear that the official take it for grant that a certain amount of money be to be spend every year upon these palace and they do their best to get rid of it without study the interest of the taxpayer In answer to the remark of the Gentleman who speak last I may assure him that the question of these repair be the subject of very careful consideration The arrangement be to place them in the hand of certain firm under contract accord to specify scale of charge for general repair a it would be almost impossible to invite tender for the many small job which require to be do but when there be new work or alteration to a large extent to be carry out then tender might be invite TANNER When the day get long would it not be possible to extend the hour during which people from London can see the picture at Hampton Court And could not permission be give to such visitor to take bundle of sandwich into the building and the ground With regard to the firm of contractor would the right Gentleman state the name of those with whom contract be last make and the fact a to the extent of the contract I will ascertain the name of the firm refer to and let the Gentleman know As to the suggestion of the Member for Mid Cork I may at once say that we have already establish a refreshment room at Gardens and will consider whether the system can be extend in the case of Hampton Court TANNER Do the tenant of the refreshment kiosk pay a fair rent reply in the affirmative I think it necessary to move the reduction of this Vote by A new work alteration and addition The detail of this Vote show that be for the extension of partition in the stable and for work and alteration of a minor character Now without go into the question whether the maintenance and repair of this Royal Palace ought to be pay by the illustrious occupier thereof I must say I think it will be contrary to the will a it be certainly inconsistent with the disposition of the Prince of Wales that such paltry sum a these should be charge on the Estimates When we call to mind what a large proportion of our income many of u have to pay for rent and repair and what a still large proportion of their income labour people have to pay for rate and tax I do think that it be add insult to injury to ask the taxpayer of the country to defray paltry expense of this kind It be well know that ample provision be make from various source to provide for the illustrious occupant of Marlborough House and it can not be say for a moment that it be necessary to relieve him of minor expense of this kind I think it be do him wrong and do wrong to the Royal Family of this country and treat the poor of this country with a very scant amount of consideration not so much a regard their pocket a their feeling to thrust a claim of this kind on the representative of the people I therefore beg to move that the Vote be reduce by the sum of It be in strict accordance with the settled practice that structural alteration of this kind shall be borne upon the Estimates In August Her Majesty Government decide that in consideration of the large expenditure already incur by His Royal Highness in improve the house he have I believe spend more than from his own purse for new work and repair besides the cost of decorate it should thenceforth be place on the same footing a Clarence House and accordingly that the cost of ordinary maintenance and repair external and internal include paint papering and whitewashing should be annually provide for in the Estimates King Some two or three year ago there be a discussion in Committee on this item in the course of which it be understood that an arrangement be come to that such item should not again appear upon the Estimates It seem that the item of to which attention have be call be for enlarge the stall for the big horse of the Prince of Wales The charge seem to me a mean one and I be surprised that in the interest of himself it have not be keep off the Estimates I must say that if I have the control of the Estimates I should certainly endeavour to disguise such an item a this indeed I would never put it in if I have no good excuse to offer for it than that it be to enlarge the stall for the big horse of the Prince of Wales I shall vote for the reduction move by my Friend and I hope it will be clearly understood that put such item a this in the Estimates be do a deal of harm to the Prince of Wales in the estimation of the people of the country Instead of do good these miserable little charge be build up in the mind of the people a store of feel which we should deplore a prejudicial to the popularity of the Prince of Wales and the Royal Family I must say I have no knowledge of any arrangement such a that mention by the Gentleman I have make inquiry of the Secretary to the Treasury and he also be unaware of any such understanding but I will make further inquiry into the matter ROBERTSON Dundee A remark fell from the Commissioner of Works just now that need a little explanation He defend the Vote on the ground that it be within the term of a certain agreement which he say be make some year ago between the Prince of Wales and another party but he do not say whom The Treasury ROBERTSON Well we have hear so much of mythical agreement a foundation for Votes of this kind that I confess I be a little and I think justifiably sceptical about such agreement I should like to ask the right Gentleman to tell u all about it the date when it be make the particular of the agreement and what be the consideration on the other side of the agreement which a I understand it commit the country to this unknown expenditure For my part I be unwilling to vote another farthing until we get the whole story I will go far and say that each Vote for Marlborough House be one of a series against which the House would do well to put it foot down Part of these amount grant to the Royal Family be found on Statute but part also be found on such mythical agreement a that which have be refer to So far a the expenditure be provide for by Statute so far a it depend on the Civil List Act I be aware this House be powerless and the money must be vote but we be entitle to know all about the distribution of these part The whole administration of the Civil List Act be shroud in mystery I be not go into that for the moment but until our legitimate demand for information a to the expenditure be meet I be not willing to sanction a farthing of these Estimates I would ask the First Commissioner now to tell u all about this special agreement which he say justify this special Vote Further though I do not expect a full answer now I would ask him to hold out a hope that the Government will make a clean breast of the whole financial position of the House in regard to His Royal Highness and unless he can do that I must object to the Vote SIR GEORGE CAMPBELL I entirely agree with my Friend that we be entitle to information but at the same time I must confess it would be a most invidious thing for the House of Commons to undertake the checking of the account of tradesman for the whitewashing and other incidental item for the repair of Marlborough House Yet it be a matter that call for some explanation that an item which last year appear a should this year have rise to The present arrangement seem to me to be in the high degree unsatisfactory It be admit that His Royal Highness undertakes to provide fitting for Marlborough House but it be difficult sometimes to draw a distinction between fitting alteration and repair If it be the fact that we be under agreement to keep up the fabric would it not be much good to make a bargain with His Royal Highness and fix upon some sum that will represent the average cost of the item for which we be liable say a year or something of that kind so that we may not every year have to scrutinize the item under B I notice another sum under head C which be suspicious for it smallness for a water rate Does that mean that Marlborough House be supply with water for It be a little surprising to u who have have experience of water rate Cheshire With the idea of support what I hold to be the proper position of the Royal Family I join in object to this Vote I be of opinion that it be a detraction from the dignity of the Royal Family that they should come to the House for these paltry sum Look for instance at this for water rate I would press on the Government the desirability of reconsider this arrangement and put these matter on a more dignified foot The right Gentleman be alone on the Government Bench just now and we can not ask him to enter on such a negotiation upon his own responsibility but I have no doubt we shall be talk upon this same subject again and meantime he might consult with his colleague I yield to no man in loyalty but it be because I dislike this petty deal with such item that I support the objection to the Vote I have only to say in answer to the Member who have just speak that the form in which the expenditure upon House be present in the Estimates be the form in which the House of Commons have see fit to have it present I do not think it would be possible to present the expenditure en bloc and from what we have hear it would appear that that would be likely to meet with some objection The Member for Dundee have talk about mystery and concealment but there really be nothing of the kind I will give him all the information in my power In an arrangement be make between the Treasury and His Royal Highness and this have be carry out since That arrangement a I have already say be that in consideration of the sum expend by His Royal Highness in improve Marlborough House thenceforward the cost of repair and maintenance should be bear upon the Estimates put it on the same footing a Clarence House The expenditure on fitting and furniture be bear by His Royal Highness That be the whole of the story and there be no mystery about it As to the for water rate that be a charge payable to the Chelsea Water Company for the privilege of a high service supply to be avail of in case of fire SIR CAMPBELL Who pay the ordinary water rate His Royal Highness SIR CAMPBELL And why not this Because it be for the protection of the house from fire ROBERTSON I thank the right Gentleman for the information which a I take it come to this that in it be agree that on consideration of the Prince of Wales spend a large sum upon a house he live in himself the Treasury bound the nation to an uncertain annual expenditure for maintenance and repair put it on the same footing a another building the right Gentleman call Clarence House This per I think affords even more justification for objection to this expenditure The right Gentleman have say nothing about the large question I refer to which be the principal motive influence me in the line I propose to take in reference to all these Royal Votes I mean the withholding from u information we be entitle to I propose therefore to oppose the Vote I do not mean to suggest that the sum for this purpose should be set down a a lump sum without detail I be perfectly willing that the House should grant sufficient to maintain the dignity of the position of His Royal Highness but when that be do do not let u have all these mean and trifle claim put forward J DARLING I would like to ask whether there be any legal obligation on the part of the Treasury for the maintenance of Marlborough House If there be it must be of a vague character for I notice the amount varies from year to year TANNER There can be no doubt in the world that the establishment of our future King should be maintain with dignity but when we find such variation in the amount submit to u it need must challenge attention and comment and then we do not get that amount of information we be entitle to ask for in Committee of Supply I must say it appear to be a foolish method of submit account to lump together an item of for maintenance and repair leave u no information a to why the item should be increase by over the amount last year and on the other hand to set out a small item like the for water rate I think we ought to take note of the improvident nature of the arrangement enter into by a Conservative Government with in It appear that when he come of age obtain Marlborough House for his residence while Prince of Wales and during hit term of residence he spend considerable sum upon adapt the house to his requirement But that be a sort of quid pro The country give the house on that condition he have what I may call a life repair lease Then a Conservative Government come in ready a Conservative Governments always be to throw away money in this way and the bargain be upset Why what would be think of a private individual who have make an arrangement for a long term of year by which he maintain the house he occupy should after an interval come to the landlord and claim to be relieve from the condition of his lease because he have already spend so much Such a thing would be regard a preposterous Yet a Conservative Government enter into this corrupt bargain for such it certainly be And when we question the right Gentleman he say my predecessor another Conservative enter into the bargain and you be bind by it We may be bind by it or not I should say that we be not At all event it be our duty to call attention to this improvident habit of bind u to most improvident arrangement in regard to the Royal Family While there be an increase for repair there be a considerable decrease on new work and alteration and the reason of the increase be that the Estimates last year be cut down too far TANNER I think that these Estimates ought to be place before the country without hesitation and without equivocation so that we might know what be really require for maintenance and repair and what for new work without tell u that a certain sum have be save in one direction but that more have be expend in another The amount for Marlborough House be only a small item but if in connection with such small item important issue can be raise how much great issue can be raise in connection with such an item a the shipbuilding for the Navy I have nothing to say against the right Gentleman the First Commissioner of Works who always try to put the best face upon matter not only in regard to his own office but with regard to the Government with which he be associate and who invariably display towards Members the great courtesy on every occasion I trust that in future the right Gentleman will endeavour to prevent a reduction be show on one item while the Vote be be swell on others I be certain the right Gentleman will agree with me that in all these matter honesty be the best policy ROBERTSON I wish the right Gentleman to explain whether the Committee be to believe that the Prince of Wales expend a sum of upon Marlborough House in the year No up to that time ROBERTSON Then when do this expenditure take place HERBERT GARDNER Essex Saffron Walden Before the right Gentleman answer that question may I ask him to consider the advisability of pay a regular fix sum for keep up Marlborough House instead of have these constantly recur item I be sure it would be more convenient to his Royal Highness and good for the Estimates of the year SIR CAMPBELL Are we to understand that up to that year his Royal Highness be bind to pay the expense out of his own pocket The new arrangement have relieve him I understand of that responsibility It be admit that his Royal Highness be bind to pay the water rate and it seem to be a dirty transaction that the Government be to put upon the nation the expense of carry the water to a certain height to guard against fire That be rather strong language I have already explain the matter Armagh The Vote we be ask to pass annually represent a capitalized sum of something like It do not appear that this expenditure be require on behalf of His Royal Highness himself but that the alteration and repair be for the benefit of German visitor who come over here It be a very humiliating thing that a palace build for Englishmen should be consider not good enough for these German sycophants THE CHAIRMAN The Gentleman language be exceedingly unbecoming and it would be difficult to characterize his argument I be only intend to say that what be good enough for Englishmen do not appear to be good enough for foreigner It occur to me that we be call upon to vote large sum year after year for the benefit of a particular individual and a the house be give to him under a specific arrangement I think he ought to be require to keep it in repair himself Green This be a Vote which stand on a different footing from the last Vote in reference to which I regret to state that in consequence of a mistake I find myself in the wrong Lobby I propose however to atone for that mistake by move the reduction of the Vote by the sum of the cost of the maintenance of Hampton Court Park The Royal park professedly exist for the public advantage and my objection be that the public enjoyment of these park be unreasonably and unjustly restrict Last year I obtain a Return which give on the one hand the total area of each Park and on the other the portion of that area from which the public be exclude That return show the exorbitant proportion of these park to which the public be not admit The case I have select that of Hampton Court Park illustrate the extent to which this obnoxious principle be carry out Hampton Court Park contain no few than acre or in other word it be considerably large than Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens put together and yet with the exception of a few privileged individual the public be entirely exclude from the enjoyment of it Last year the First Commissioner be good enough to say he would inquire if it would be possible to remove the brick wall now enclose the Park on one side for nearly two mile and see whether it could be replace by something of a more open character Nothing have however be do The First Commissioner meet my argument last year by the statement that the Park have never be open to the public I that be true but I hardly suppose that the right Gentleman mean to advance that a a serious argument and I do not think I need deal with it The right Gentleman also say that the Park be not require in that locality Well it be true that the neighbourhood be exceptionally favour a it possess Hampton Court Gardens and Park but if the right Gentleman wish to take his stand on that argument I think I may put before him an alternative course If a large open space be not require in that neighbourhood there be certainly many locality in the Metropolis where it be grievously need If then the Government refuse to open this park why not sell it and with the proceeds of the sale provide a park in some grow neighbourhood in the East of London I protest altogether against the Committee be require to pay for the sole purpose a it seem to me of provide enjoyment for a few favoured individual who I be very well able to provide garden for themselves I beg to move the reduction I have propose As I promise the Member last year this subject have be consider Hampton Court Park be undoubtedly the midst of a locality which be admit by the Member to be exceptionally favour in the matter of pleasure garden and recreation ground and so far a I have be able to ascertain there have be no such strong pressure of public opinion bring to bear upon u a should overcome the natural reluctance of the Treasury to add to the expense of keep up this park There would certainly be considerable addition to this expense if it be throw open a the Member suggest It would also cost a large sum even to pull down the brick wall not to speak of supply in it place such a would be suitable for a public park If the park be throw open we should have to provide path and gate and we should also require a large number of The cost would be really increase by some hundred of pound annually Under the circumstance we have not think we should be justify in throw the park open to the public The right Gentleman have put his refusal to open this park on two ground The first be that there be already adequate accommodation in the matter of park for the public in the locality The right Gentleman allude to Park but in Park only about acres out of be open to the public As to the amount receive for key at Hampton Court one guinea be pay for each key and the total amount obtain be so that we be call upon to pay per annum for maintain a park use by about person In point of fact however the park be not reserve for those person but a great part for certain breeding horse and I be obliged again to ask the right Gentleman what become of our foal I have be tell that the cream colour horse that occasionally appear roam about in the park so that apparently we pay per annum for the purpose of maintain close to the Metropolis a park for the benefit of person of certain foal which we never see and of certain cream colour horse which we uncommonly seldom see We be perfectly ready to vote the money spend upon this park if we can have the run of the park but not otherwise I shall certainly support the Amendment We be prepare at all time to vote money for the construction of gate or for the maintenance of path if by so do we can obtain the opening of a large area a an additional lung of the Metropolis There be at Hampton Court something in the way of green field belong to the public but at present the space which the people be allow to use there be extremely restrict It be time that the Office of Works should realize that these public space be to be utilize for the public We be determine that the public shall not be shut out from them We on this side have do with the favoured few We do not know anything about the favoured few and we intend to persevere with Amendments of this kind year by year until we get the whole of this space for the use of the person who seek a little fresh air on Bank Holidays and other occasion We will allow the person who pay for key to use the park in the same way a the general public use it but in no other way SHAW Bradford Central It appear to me that it will be impossible much long to exclude the public from this park I must say I think there be a good deal of force in the argument that the general public ought not to be call upon to pay any large sum towards throw the park open but I can not but think that the cost might be defray by the London County Council Of course I will consider the suggestion of the right Gentleman who have have much experience in this Department Monmouth There be something more serious than the mere question of expenditure upon this park and that be the principle upon which the exclusion of the public be base It be all very well to call these space royal park We can understand appropriate a park for a Royal palace to be use by Royalty but this be no such case Here we have a large piece of ground which be admit to be public property It should be use for the public We on this side be not disincline to pay for public space if the public use them but here you have a park belonging to the public take from the public and the expense of keep the public out of their own property be defray out of the public purse That be the real common sense of this Vote It be true that I do not rest my argument upon the question of this be a Royal park but I wish to prevent any misapprehension arise on the subject Whatever the policy of admit the public may be it would be an entirely new thing This have always be a reserved part of a Royal park From time to time portion of the Royal park have be give up to the public for instance it be only within the last or year that Regent Park be open to the public It be not the case that the public be ever admit into Hampton Court Park and they be not now exclude from something to which they formerly have access The right Gentleman seem to think that this be a new proposal though he do not base his argument upon that I would point out that for the last four or five year Members on this side of the House have be make these proposal For four year we have a controversy in this House a to a rule lay down by the Ranger that nobody should drive through Richmond Park except in a private carriage so that those who do not possess private carriage be not allow to drive there To my own knowledge for four or five year it have be urge that this portion of Hampton Court Park should be throw open to the public I would ask whether the question of expense be the sole obstacle in the way of open the park If so this Committee will always be willing to pay that expense I believe from information I have that the obstacle be not the expense of throw the park open and that the land be retain for the benefit of more or less private individual I would ask the right Gentleman to say whether the only obstacle to throw open the land be the question of expense Aberdeenshire I should like to be quite clear a to what this piece of land be use for If it be use for improve the breed of horse of course that be for the benefit of the public If however the stud be not successful and the horse breed be of no particular character I think that the last refuge of the First Commissioner be cut away If the land be use a a private garden for the benefit of certain private person I think the right Gentleman would do well to take the advice give him and see whether the park can not be throw open Surrey Epsom I think it only just to state on behalf of my constituent that when a representation be make to the right Gentleman the First Commissioner of Works by certain person at in favour of open a locked gate at Hampton Court opposite a ferry so a to save them a long walk in obtain access to the garden he at once respond to the request make to him and do a he be ask without incur any extra expense I be much oblige to my right Friend for what he have state and I may take this opportunity to point out that the expense incur in connection with the Hampton Court be for the breeding establishment no portion of the money be apply to the thoroughbred establishment which be maintain wholly out of the fund of the Civil List TANNER With regard to the gate that have be speak of the right Gentleman have in the first place consider the convenience not of the bulk of the people but of the constituent of and right Gentlemen opposite What we want to assure be the convenience of the inhabitant of London generally Instead of talk about the cost of the gate and path which must be a small sum step should be take to throw down the hideous brick wall which bound the park Surely if we be to take example from other country and follow the mode adopt in the park of France Germany and other civilized place that wall would be at once remove and we should get rid of all those obstacle which be now obtrude by obstinate against the wish of the people I move the reduction of the Vote by Richmond Park consist of acre and you have an expenditure of for police and for road Then you have acre of and you be call upon to pay for that besides the amount expend on the police and the road Now pay for itself I have always understand I do not know why We have a number of ranger and and that sort of thing You have change the name they use to be gamekeeper but whatever the name they be the same and still exist Would any gentleman in this House or anywhere else with a park of acre consist of plantation and grass spend upon it per annum irrespective of the road and get nothing for it That be our position with regard to Richmond Park and I think I be exceedingly moderate in only move a reduction of I leave you per annum for police and road and to amuse yourselves with your ranger and gamekeeper but I do think that a protest ought to be register against this excessive expenditure upon this Park TANNER I really think that Gentlemen on this side have some reason to at least expect a response from Her Majesty adviser upon this question upon which they might have expect to be challenge It be ten minute to Seven of the clock the Chairman leave the Chair to report Progress Northampton I desire to move the reduction of this Vote by the sum of in respect of the expenditure on Richmond Park In round number the amount expend on this park be I think per annum Well look at the cost of police and the probable cost of mend the road which can not be very much consider the small amount of traffic there must be something like spent on the tree and grass in the park We on this side of the House a a rule be not able to have great park of our own but I appeal to the landed interest on the other side I ask whether if an Member have a park of or acres the road be maintain he would think of expend a year on it Yet that be what be do in the case of Richmond Park How the money be spend or squander I have no clear idea There be some calf in the park some with horn and some without and we be tell that they cost a great deal of money but I doubt whether in private deer park owner dream of spending as much a a year because of these animal I think that this Vote be excessive and that in move this reduction I be altogether within the mark I be certain that Richmond Park could be well maintain for a year BUXTON Tower Hamlets Poplar I should like to ask to ask why it be that we have the charge for and gatekeeper lump together instead of be give separately in the Estimates and also I should like to ask for an explanation of the increase under this head FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS Dublin University It would not be reasonable for me to go through all the item of expenditure in connection with the maintenance of this park but I can assure the Member for Northampton that the Government have be do what they can especially in recent year to reduce the expenditure for Richmond Park as well a for the other park It be however impossible that we can have such a handsome park a that at Richmond maintain as cheaply a an ordinary private park In answer to the remark of the Member for Poplar I may explain that the increase expense this year for and gatekeeper be due to the fact that we have have to make some provision for the superannuation of constable who under the new arrangement a to James and the Green Parks will no longer be in our service There will however be an ultimate saving of expense when the arrangement be complete and police duty will be perform by the keeper in conjunction with their ordinary work BUXTON The right Gentleman have not answer my question I desire to know why this item for keeper be put down in a lump sum I be afraid I can give no further explanation I do not think the right Gentleman have give a reasonable answer to my criticism The right Gentleman say we can not expect to keep up a public park as cheaply a a private park I do not ask him to keep up Richmond Park a cheaply but what I say be that the owner of a private park would make some profit out of his property by graze and grant that we do not attempt to make a profit in that way surely be enough to be out of pocket I trust the right Gentleman will give me some explanation of the matter for the public outside take a strong view of these matter and may suspect that the part of this money go into the pocket of somebody or other I see we have a bailiff of the Royal Parks who have to look after all the Royal Parks for we have a Banger a Superintendent at a salary of and an Assistant Superintendent at per annum There be besides this a large sum pay to gamekeeper though I do not find them in the Estimates I protest against the payment for gamekeeper over and over again and at last the item disappear but the individual do not they remain They do very much the same thing but they be not call gamekeeper This show how necessary it be to look into these matter I should like to ask how many person make a good thing out of Richmond Park There be a considerable number of house there grant by Her Majesty and there be garden round those house I should like to know if the gardener who attend to these garden be pay out of this Vote be understand to deny the justice of the personal imputation suggest in the observation of the Member for Northampton and to say that it would take two or three day to give the Member the information he ask for Cornwall I must take exception to the air of innocence assume by the right Gentleman He say it would take three day to give the Member for Northampton the information he ask for Well I contend that even if it take three week to give it the right Gentleman duty be to offer that information I desire to know and perhaps the right Gentleman can find time to answer this who be the Rangers and Deputy Rangers we see put down in this Vote Is the Ranger a Royal personage be he a pluralist and what work do he do for his pay I be tell that the Ranger of Green Park be a Royal personage but I have never see him look after the gatekeeper and there If I do not get any information on this point I shall move to report Progress The Ranger a the Member himself must know be His Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge I do not know anything of the sort The Ranger have a considerable authority over the park and I have often derive advantage from his advice and I thank the right Gentleman for the useful piece of information he have give I may remark that I be not in the habit of put question to waste the time of the Committee I put question to elicit information a I have a right to do How on earth be I to know the various office of these Royal Dukes and With regard to the Ranger of these park I must say it seem to me that the of Her Majesty Forces ought to have enough to do in connection with his military duty without have to occupy his time with these pettifog duty in connection with the park MUNRO FERGUSON I wish to call attention to the question of Constitution Hill a subject which be discuss the other day in connection with another matter I take this the early opportunity of again raise the subject I observe that a number of Members base their opposition to Constitution Hill be close except to privileged person on the ground that they be not include in the list but I be disposed to think that if the Members of this House be admit to the privilege the chance of the public claim to use the road be fairly consider would be in no degree augment I think this drive should be open on the ground of public convenience Constitution Hill form a direct line between important district of the Metropolis for example from this House to Hyde Park Corner In the same way a the drive across the Horse Guards Parade now open to the public be a great public convenience so would the benefit of open Constitution Hill be felt Now we have to take a detour by James and or go round by that huge enclosure Buckingham Palace Gardens One point raise in this discussion be the privacy of Buckingham Palace Gardens I do not know that there be anyone in Buckingham Palace for whom privacy be require Of course any time Her Majesty be at the Palace it would be perfectly simple to have the road close But even now the whole front of the Palace be use for vehicular traffic and I think that the right Gentleman himself would admit that the privacy of the Palace be already secure as far a it may be by the enclosure of Buckingham Palace Gardens I think another reason for support the opening of the Hill be that the list be an absurd relic of privilege which ought to be abolish I beg to move the reduction of the Vote by HERBERT GARDNER Essex Saffron Walden I rise with the utmost pleasure to support the proposition of my Friend It seem to me so reasonable and moderate that it ought to command the attention of the right Gentleman But if for some official reason the right Gentleman be unable to give it his independent consideration I think it might well claim the support of Members opposite Members of Parliament have formerly the exclusive privilege of drive in cab to the House of Commons through Storey Gate That privilege be now take away from them and share by the general public And in regard to Richmond Park it be state in a previous debate that formerly the Ranger would only allow carriage to pass round the Park No one on this side hold and I do not believe Members opposite would hold that only carriage should be permit in these place But on Constitution Hill not only be carriages the only vehicle allow but absolutely not everybody carriage only the carriage of a small minority of lady and gentleman who have that especial privilege which be call the What we ask Her Majesty Government to do be to open the roadway and to relieve the congested district on either side of the Park The right Gentleman know that it have often be suggest that a road should be make from the North of London down to the Thames in order to relieve the crowded traffic of Bond Street and James Street All who live in that part of London know how inconvenient it be at time All we ask the right Gentleman to do be to open a roadway which be pay for and maintain by the taxpayer and not reserve it to the use of a small minority of lady and gentleman who I believe pay their tax although I be not certain whether they do so in all case I ask Her Majesty Government to consider this subject on the ground that the roadway be maintain by the taxpayer that to open it would be to relieve a congested district and that it would abolish an absurd system of privilege which be now completely out of date SHAW This subject have already be discuss once this Session and I think there will be no desire to discuss it at any length I will make a suggestion which might remedy the inconvenience complain of It would be no doubt an enormous convenience to the public to have a short cut from Hyde Park Corner to Buckingham Gate It would be a great relief to the traffic But I have always felt in regard to Constitution Hill that it be a narrow roadway with tree on either side If the road be open to the public it would be necessary to cut down the tree on one side and for my part I would have very great hesitation in do that It be one of the most beautiful walk in London and it would be a very serious detriment to the Park if we be to cut down the tree I have often think that a new road might be make from the bottom of Hamilton Place to Buckingham Gate There be already a broad walk there which lie for the first half of the distance in a kind of dell and be well adapt for abroad road If that be do it would avoid the necessity of cut down the tree on Constitution Hill The difficulty would be solve and a new road would be open for traffic while Constitution Hill could be reserve solely to the use of Her Majesty and the exist privilege extend to a certain number of people would thus be abolish I throw out the suggestion to the right Gentleman It be one which have often occur to me and one which have I be longer in the position which he now occupy I have think of submit to the House At any rate I think it be a good mode of deal with the case than that of cut down the tree on Constitution Hill Any suggestion come from the right Gentleman who have previously fill the office I now have the honour to hold will of course be receive by me with the great possible consideration but a this suggestion come now before me for the first time I can not at present express any opinion upon it Constitution Hill have always be regard a Her Majesty private drive in connection with Buckingham Palace I admit that there be a certain amount of inconvenience in this arrangement to a certain portion of the people but Constitution Hill be open for all the purpose of foot passenger and it be only those who drive in carriage or cab who will be favour if the proposal of the Gentleman be adopt The suggestion however be one that do not affect the public generally and it be not probable that those from whom it really emanate would be glad to see omnibuses admit as well a cab Hear hear Perhaps the Gentleman would also like to see tramcar there Hear hear Well I confess that I be unable to take that view The Gentleman who move the reduction of the Vote speak of our closing Constitution Hill MUNRO FERGUSON I think I use the word partial close The word I object to be close Instead of closing or partially close the Royal Parks we have do all we can to render them more accessible to the public and I will only now repeat that I will consider the suggestion of the right Gentleman opposite Northampton The right Gentleman say I be in favour of omnibus and cab go up Constitution Hill and so I be while personally I should not have the slight objection to Does the right Gentleman know that omnibus and cab be not exclude from the Green Park and the Mall while they be only exclude from a portion of Hyde Park on the ground that so many private carriage go there to make a sort of spectacular show for we poor who go to look at them I can not see why the cab which start from Marlborough House and go along the Mall and might go through Buckingham Gate pass right under the window of the Palace should not be allow to turn up Constitution Hill The right Gentleman say Constitution Hill ought not to be open because it have never be close No Well that be how it appear to me and I say there be no reason why it should not be open and I have never although I have often hear the matter discuss in this House hear a single good reason urge against that proposal Here in the centre of London be a large space have on one side a park and on the other a large garden between which run a road which be precisely the road require for the use of the public I be convince that if Gentlemen vote for this proposal in sufficient number Her Majesty will most readily grant the boon to Her subject I do not think however that Her Majesty Ministers have be quite candid on the subject on the contrary I think they have misstate the strong feeling which exist on the part of the people upon the subject and I think we ought to convey that feeling in the vote we be about to give on this question I may say that I think the of my right Friend Shaw be a most astounding one He say Let u leave this road sacred to Royalty and have a new one This road be maintain at the public cost and he wish it to be leave only for the use of Members on the Royal Family But there be the Privy Councillors also and be they to exclude And what about those Elysian Fields that be now consider sacred to nursemaid and child Why should the road be keep for the exclusive use of the Queen I be sure Her Majesty be not in the least anxious to have a road sacred to her The reason why the public be not permit to drive along Constitution Hill be not on account of any objection on the part of Her Majesty but because a few person like the swagger of be able to drive along it while the public be oblige to walk That be the reason why Constitution Hill be to be keep shut from general vehicular traffic You Courtney will remember very well what happen in the Reign of George III You will remember that an Irish gentleman ask for the privilege of drive along Constitution Hill but say I can not give you that but a you have be a faithful servant of the public and vote for everything I want I will make you an Irish Peer That be the sort of privilege this exclusiveness have be consider The road be not to be keep open for the benefit of the public but in favour of a few privileged who want to drive along it to the exclusion of everybody else I do hope we shall by the vote that will be give on this question show that there be a considerable number of Members of this House who think it can do no harm to allow the public the use of a road which be maintain at considerable public expense CAVENDISH Cumberland Whitehaven Although I do not remember the time of George I do remember the discussion about throw open the road between Marlborough House and Storey Gate and that I take some part in bring about the result That proposal be ground upon the fact that it could not interfere with the privilege of the Royal Family In the same way I do not see that the user of Constitution Hill would by any mean interfere with the privilege of the Royal Family and therefore a I understand the reduction of the Vote be move in order to obtain the sense of the Committee on that proposal I shall think it my duty to follow the Member into the Lobby Well Sir I also at that time propose that a roadway should be make across James Park Ornamental Water The proposal do not find favour at the time either with the authority or with the House of Commons But I rise to point out to the right Gentleman that the user to a moderate extent of Constitution Hill can by no mean interfere with the enjoyment of it by Royalty and therefore I shall feel it my duty to follow the Member into the Lobby With regard to the suggestion to open a road from Hamilton Place across the Green Park the right Gentleman the Member for Bradford have already make such a wilderness of that part of London and his attempt to make Hyde Park Corner an ornamental part of the Metropolis be such a conspicuous failure not only by the removal of the Arch sinking it down into a place where it be never intend to stand but turn it sideways to the main road where it be an object of ridicule and also by place in the open space an absurd statue that I look with great suspicion on any proposal come from the same quarter Shall I be in order in draw attention on this Vote to in Greenwich Park CHAIRMAN Not until the Question before the Committee be dispose of DE LISLE Leicestershire Mid I shall support this Motion not only for reason more or less the same a those of my right Friend but also because I have a further and ulterior object in view namely the opening up of the Mall to Trafalgar Square and so relieve the present congestion of traffic from the West by There be really no difficulty in open Constitution Hill The road be a good width already and if the footpath on the left side go downwards from the Archway be throw into the road it would be about as wide a the Strand be in some place This would entail the loss of not more than or tree The further end of the Mall be now of no use to anybody but if cut through Spring Gardens into Trafalgar Square the great open Boulevard connect Kensington and with the Strand and the Embankment would be one of the fine in Europe not to speak of the relief to traffic in and the convenience of Members of Parliament living in Kensington and SHAW My alternative proposal be make under the idea that if Constitution Hill be open up it would be necessary to widen it and in order to do so a number of tree would have to be cut down which would be a great misfortune It be only in that view that I make the suggestion and if it should turn out that I be mistake I will gladly advocate the opening o Constitution Hill Mid It seem to me to be unfair to the country constituencies that they should be call upon to pay a large sum for the Parks and Pleasure Grounds of London Here in this Estimate be a sum of for Richmond Park of for Greenwich Park of for Regent Park of for James the Green and Hyde Parks for Park and for Hampton Court Park I especially omit all mention of Gardens because from that place other part of the country may be suppose to derive some benefit see that be an experimental station But with regard to the other park it must be remember that London be the rich place in the world and I maintain that Londoners ought to pay for their own park because although they be call Royal park they be really nothing else than pleasure ground for the benefit of the people of London and therefore they should be maintain solely by Londoners London can well afford to do that if it want money it be only needful to put a tax on ground landlord and you will get plenty The Vote altogether be and I protest that this be a great deal too large a sum for people in distant part of the country to be call upon to pay for the benefit of rich Londoners I therefore move the reduction of the Vote by HOWELL Green I can not support the Amendment If Londoners be to have those park under their own control no doubt they will be well satisfied to pay for them But the people of London have scarcely what can be call even a part proprietary right in them they have only the right to walk in them just a people come to London from other part of the country have Those park be to all intent and purpose national park and not London park They be merely London park because they happen to be situate in the Metropolis CLARK I be astonish at my Friend talk of these a national park On his principle every park in every large city in the three kingdom be a national park in the same sense I think the time have come when the expense of maintain the park ought to be bear by the people of London which through it County Council have control of it own affair You must remember that when any unfortunate provincial come to London he leave a great deal with the keeper and thus enable them to pay their rate The people in the country ought not to be call upon to maintain park for the benefit of the wealthy people of London It be all very well to say that the Government make a grant towards the maintenance of the Botanic Gardens at Edinburgh But after all it be only a miserable Vote and you be do your best to take it away from u I be sorry to intervene at this stage of the proceeding and I only do so because I feel it incumbent upon me to move the reduction of the Vote by I make this Motion a a protest against the conduct of the Government in deprive the people of London of the right of meeting in James Park The people of London be compel in common with the rest of their countryman to maintain the Park The Government have absolutely prohibit the people from meet in Trafalgar Square and six or eight month ago I point out to the First Commissioner of Works and the Home Secretary that there be a capital alternative site that site be the Horse Guards Parade The Home Secretary promise to take the question into his consideration and after four month deliberation he announce to the House that the Government have come to the conclusion that the people ought not to be permit to meet at that place I think it be one of the very best site in London for meeting purpose It be exceedingly quiet the spot belong to the people there be no privileged class so far a I be aware who have any more right to it than we have and yet we be shut out from it Even the Home Secretary admit that the people ought to have some place of meet It be impossible for u to raise or with which to pay for hall in which to meet and express our difference with various Governments or to ventilate our grievance real or imaginary and no matter what Government be in office the people will always have something to say in regard to the doings of the Government It will be exceedingly dangerous and I believe the Home Secretary practically admit this view of the matter to attempt to prevent the people from meet to ventilate their grievance The Horse Guards Parade be a centre place upon which the people from the east west north and south could converge a gathering of people there would not interfere with the comfort or convenience of any inhabitant neither will the traffic of the Metropolis be interfere with I beg to move that the Vote be reduce by Cornwall It be a very important subject the Member for have raise and I hope he will take the sense of the Committee on his Motion for the purpose of place before the citizen of London the necessity of make use of this open space the Horse Guards Parade now that the Government have drive u from our accustomed place of meet What single substantial objection be there against this use of the Parade For the great part of everyday the space be unoccupied There be military meeting there sometimes and I have myself take part in meeting of Volunteers on the Parade Why draw a distinction and refuse to allow citizen in their everyday dress to meet and discuss public question where you allow these same citizen to meet in uniform and go through a number of military evolution I heartily support the proposal though I do not for a moment waive our claim to meet in Trafalgar Square There be many place where we be entitle to meet but I do not wish to go into the general question There can be no quibble objection to this Parade a a place of meet it be admirably situate from it position and for the great part of the day it be desert I really do not understand what objection there can be unless the Government mean to wage war against the right of free public meeting everywhere ROPER Kensington As a Metropolitan Member I be not dispose to complain of the Member for the Division for interpose in the discussion of a question that be really of Metropolitan interest because I be one of those who consider that Metropolitan interest should be regard a of Imperial interest and that because they be Metropolitan and I think Imperial taxation should bear a fair charge for the cost of such interest But I do venture to protest a a Metropolitan Member and a represent a large quiet and orderly portion of the citizen of London against the Member come down to the House and endeavour to open a scene for riot and disorder in the midst of the Metropolis I be one of the last who would wish in any way to curtail any of the facility that exist for the large public meeting I have myself use those facility largely in the past and I hope frequently to use them in the future but I do say that the broad expanse of Hyde Park lend itself admirably to every possible legitimate occasion for public meeting No An Member deny that but I say it be impossible to conceive of any public meeting so large or any number of meeting so extensive that Hyde Park would not offer sufficient space As to convenience of situation why there be but the difference of five minute walk between Hyde Park and the Horse Guards Parade and it be idle to pretend that in point of position one be more convenient than the other The Member for tell u that the spot belong to the people and therefore he claim it for the use of the people and that they have the right to meet there Yes Sir it belong to the people and for that reason I claim it should be retain for the use of the people and not hand over to a noisy band of agitator I would deny these the right to come into such place and still more would I deny the right of those criminal class who do it must be admit very commonly follow in the wake of such demonstration An MEMBER And of Lord Mayors Shows ROPER Yes but there be no proposition to open the Horse Guards Parade to the Civic Procession The Member for tell u it be a quiet spot and so it be and so it should be for not only be it situate in close proximity to the Royal Palaces and close to Government office it be very near where the Imperial Parliament hold it Sittings and therefore I think there be every reason to retain it in it quietude and not run the risk of disorder and disturbance so near the House Northampton I do not quite understand whether you put the reduction generally on the Vote Am I at liberty to raise the question of enclosure in the park THE CHAIRMAN No the Member be premature ELLIS Nottingham I think it will be felt especially after the speech of the right Gentleman the Member for and of the Member for North Kensington that a reply from the Chief Commissioner of Works would tend to shorten discussion It strike me the Member move the Amendment in a clear and temperate manner and unless it can be show that his proposition be unreasonable I shall support him I quite understand the Member to say it be his intention to take a Division a mark his protest He admit I think that this matter be fully debate when the whole subject of open air public meeting in the Metropolis be thoroughly discuss earlier in the Session The right Gentleman be under some slight misapprehension I do not say the question I have raise be fairly discuss when the Speech from the Throne be before the House I say that the question of Royal Parks have be fairly discuss this evening I may be permit to say in reply to the Member for North Kensington that if he have to tramp from to Hyde Park a many people have in order to take part in popular demonstration he would appreciate the distance of the Parade from Hyde Park The two place be minute walk apart and the walk there and back minute make a sensible difference to a man who have walk from the far East of London I think we ought to have the support of those who boast themselves Constitutionalists if they be anxious to maintain the right of free speech in open space Surely it be well to allow the people to come together to blow off superfluous steam and ventilate their grievance than to sit on the safety valve until an explosion take place CLARK We have hear no reason why meeting should not take place on the Parade One advantage would be there be no damage to be do All demonstration in Hyde Park be to a certain extent harmful to the Park The grass be trample down and in danger of be destroy an open space without turf be dry and not open to the same objection This place be the more necessary for public meeting see that you have take away the right the people enjoy for year to meet in Trafalgar Square The remark of the Member for North Kensington would apply equally to meeting in Hyde Park or anywhere else But poor people can not afford to organize a big meeting in a public hall guinea for a night in James Hall be something considerable to them Indeed in the Metropolis it be very difficult to get a hall for a popular meeting Exeter Hall be take away for other purpose in fact we be boycott all round It be very difficult to get a large hall for a popular Radical meeting Proprietors be usually Conservative and do not like their premise use by people who may raise inconvenient question that might lose a Member such a the Member for Kensington for instance his seat at the next election We require public meeting to discuss public matter no matter whether the Government be Liberal or Conservative indeed I think I have assist in the organization of more demonstration against Liberal Governments than Conservative Governments We require sometimes to keep a Liberal Government straight and we have to protest sometimes against some Conservative Jingo policy against the national interest But if you be go to deny u the use of all open ground where would you have u hold our meeting We do not wish to have disorder we wish to have matter settle quietly Let the County Council or some other authority exercise control over the term and condition under which meeting shall be hold Your present policy of objection and do nothing cause deep irritation FIRTH Dundee The right Gentleman the First Commissioner of Works make no reply let me put the question to him in a direct form On what ground do the Government claim the right or assert the wisdom of exclude the people of London from the Horse Guards Parade The observation of the Gentleman opposite my former opponent Sir about riot and agitator and the criminal class be in the usual line and will not I think be adopt by the right Gentleman JAMES Kent The Gentleman ask by what authority Her Majesty Government prevent Her Majesty subject from hold meeting on the Horse Guards Parade FIRTH No the right Gentleman mistake me entirely I do not say by what authority I know they have authority I ask why What be the reason for the exclusion JAMES At any rate I may say have take part year ago in pass the Parks Regulation Act through the House that there be a very strong feeling in the House of Commons at that time that the assemblage of a large number of people in the public park and especially near the Houses of Parliament be much to be deprecate The Member be no doubt aware that there be an old Act on the Statute Book which prevent the assembling of any meeting within a certain limit of where Parliament be hold it sit An MEMBER That be not on the Statute Book JAMES If the Member will refer to the Statutes at Large he will find that he have no warrant for his interruption Whether it be orderly or not I leave the Committee to decide FIRTH I make no interruption JAMES I refer to the Member for The right Gentleman be entirely mistaken I do not say there be no such Statute in existence JAMES It show the inconvenience of the interpolation of remark while another Member be address the Committee As a matter of fact the Parks Regulation Act be specially frame with a view to allow the Government of the day by the issuing of a Proclamation or the affixing of notice to prevent a meeting in the Royal Parks The passage through the street of a large number of people have in view the object of attend a meeting be I venture to say a cause of great public inconvenience For my part I regret that Hyde Park should have be set apart for such purpose James Park have never be so used and the Green Park have always be keep free from such proceeding I hope the Government will not under any condition think of inflict such a nuisance a this upon the Metropolis The Member for asks why those who come from the East End of London should be call upon to trudge a long distance past the Mall and Trafalgar Square to go to Hyde Park Well I say a I say year ago it would be much good for the people of that district to hold their meeting at the East End or a be point out at the time I refer to that Primrose Hill be a much more convenient site for such meeting and more accessible from the residence of the majority of person who attend them But I think it be extremely wrong to induce those who live in the East End to proceed through crowded thoroughfare to hold a meeting in the West End which have much setter be hold in their immediate neighbourhood I may venture to challenge the law of the right Gentleman I presume it be material to the discussion before the Committee or you Sir would not have allow it I think he be mistake a to the Statute which do not forbid any meeting but only meeting for certain purpose JAMES Will the Member allow me to say I be perfectly well aware of the term of the Statute The Statute forbid the holding of any meeting for the purpose of address any petition notice or remonstrance to Parliament within the City and Liberties of Westminster while Parliament be sit but it do not preclude a meeting be hold under the very nose of Parliament for the purpose of pass a resolution I understand the right Gentleman to say any meeting whatever and I have many reason for know that be incorrect Swansea Town The objection urge by Gentlemen opposite would apply to Hyde Park as well a anywhere else Where I would ask be the poor people to go Primrose Hill be suggest but I remember one occasion when people be tell Trafalgar Square be the place instead of Hyde Park Surely the Horse Guards Parade be a most convenient place for meeting The people of London be be drive from pillar to post in search of a place in which to hold meeting without danger of interruption Gloucester I do not intend to vote on this question but after the speech of the right Gentleman the Member for the Isle of it seem to me the duty of every Liberal to do so The right Gentleman will deny the people of London the right to meet in any part of the Metropolis save Primrose Hill or the East End I should have think that the Horse Guards Parade be a very good place to meet in Mid The right Gentleman opposite evidently have no knowledge of London outside Club land He do not know how far Primrose Hill be from the East End of London probably he think they be in the same neighbourhood Why Primrose Hill be half way to Hampstead and it be nothing short of an insult to the people of London to ask them to go there to hold their open air meeting The speech of the right Gentleman opposite do him credit a a legislator and an I understand him to quote from the Parks Regulation Act Oh no The right Gentleman say the Government have the right to issue a Proclamation forbid meeting in the Parks under the Parks Regulation Act of No to pass rule That be a very different thing Passing rule be not issue a proclamation The right Gentleman have represent the Act in an utterly erroneous light He have represent that meeting be forbid in the Green Park and James Park whilst they be allow in Hyde Park but that be not the fact The Act do not contain any provision prohibit public meeting any more than it contain provision authorize them The three Parks mention be on entirely the same footing authority be give to lay down rule which you can see post up in the Parks On behalf of my Friends sit round me I wish to say that whilst we be not disappoint at the attitude the Government have take up we be grieve that we have be treat with such scant courtesy I state when I move the reduction of the Vote that I have no wish to obstruct the proceeding my wish be to obtain from the Government a statement of their reason for refuse to the people the right of meet on the Horse Guards Parade We have ask one Member of the Government after another for a reason but none have be give I would venture to point out that it will be utterly impossible to get through the Estimates if so much time be spend on these small Votes I understand the Member to move the reduction of the Vote a a protest against the public be prevent from hold meeting on the Horse Guards Parade and not with the view of call upon me to give any further account of the action of the Government in the matter In the course of the debate upon the Address my right Friend the Home Secretary explain why it would be inconvenient in the public interest that large public meeting should be hold on the Horse Guards Parade or in James Park in the immediate neighbourhood of the public office and the Houses of Parliament Northampton Last year on the Vote for Richmond Park and Greenwich Park I draw attention to the large amount of space from the enjoyment of which the public be exclude In Greenwich Park the public be exclude from the acre which surround the Ranger Lodge occupy by Lord The right Gentleman the First Commissioner of Works say that this land cost the public nothing but I maintain that even if the poor of London lose nothing but the enjoyment of it that be too much and ought not to be permit The or acre of Greenwich Park that have be add to the ground of the Ranger Lodge have never be open to the public of my anxiety to secure to the public the enjoyment of the Parks I may mention that in the case of Regent Park the expire lease of the Society will not be renew I think the Member will do me the justice to admit that since I have have the honour of hold my present office I have do all I could to make the Royal Parks more available to the public and to increase their value to the people Has this in Greenwich Park be recently add to the Ranger Lodge I think we have a right to know that It be add in Donegal I wish to draw the right Gentleman attention to the tree in Kensington Gardens near the Round Pond Many tree have be cut down during recent year and the condition under which others grow have be alter by level Many of them now grow in a bed that be not natural to them their root be too thickly cover with soil The health and even the life of many of the tree particularly the elm have be imperilled in this way Has the right Gentleman any report a to the operation which have be carry out and do he intend to replace the tree that have have to be remove I have consult the best authority on the subject and have have numerous report send to me from time to time For one reason or another I believe it be impossible to save the old tree but I have very good report of the young tree which be be plant on a good system and the Committee may rest assure that I shall not fail to take any step likely to prevent the garden be denude of tree where it be desirable to have them Sir CAMPBELL For year I have be hammer away at this matter and have never be able to get any satisfaction I do not believe it be old age that be kill the tree Old tree tree and young tree be all die in certain part of the Park showing that there must be something wrong with the soil ROBERTSON Dundee I do not propose to renew at this stage the opposition that be offer in Committee to this Vote but I do wish to call attention to the remarkable observation offer by the First Commissioner and to the still more remarkable explanation offer by him this evening I understand the right Gentleman to say in the first instance that the expenditure on Marlborough House be in consequence of an agreement enter into in between the Treasury and His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales When I put a question to him he answer that there have be no such agreement and that he never say there have be such an agreement Now Sir in vindication of the position which I and others have take up I wish to say that in refer to the ordinary report of the proceeding of this House I find that the statement make by the right Gentleman be thus report in the Times newspaper explain that the charge now ask to be provide for be undertake by the nation on agreement enter into in in consideration of His Royal Highness spend a large sum on Marlborough House I myself in the course of the debate repeatedly refer to the understanding or whatever it be a an agreement without any objection be take by the right Gentleman The senior Member for Northampton go a good deal far than I do because he say it be a corrupt and profligate agreement I do not mention this by way of insist on the accuracy of the epithet he apply to it but rather to show that he understand the First Commissioner to defend the Vote a the result of an agreement between the Treasury and the Prince of Wales I do think that in justice to the House it be necessary to call attention to defence of this kind which be perpetually be set up in Committee of Supply and I do think that and right Gentlemen who have to defend Votes in this Committee owe it to themselves and to u to be extremely careful and precise and accurate in the statement they make in this Committee especially on subject of this nature I can assure the Gentleman that when I speak the other evening I intend to use the very word I use in my reply to his question and I believe I do because I read out my statement from a note which I have before me namely that it be a direction give by the Treasury under certain circumstance which I explain I be extremely sorry that the Gentleman should have misunderstand me Cornwall Do I understand that His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales do not spend anything on the repair of Marlborough House Is the nation under the obligation of maintain this fabric both externally and internally I believe on a former occasion some statement be make that the Marlborough House property be not on the same footing a the other Royal Palaces but belong to the nation and be occupy by His Royal Highness on some sort of lease I should like to know whether that be so Marlborough House be in former time a Royal Palace and it have also be use a an office but at the time the Prince of Wales be come of age an Act of Parliament be pass to enable Her Majesty to vest Marlborough House in His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales during his life In His Royal Highness have spend a large sum out of his private resource on the maintenance of Marlborough House and the Treasury then decide that have regard to this expenditure it would be fair that the external and internal repair of the house should be make in the same way a in the case of certain other Royal Palaces ELLIS Nottinghamshire In the present Estimates there be a sum of ask for in connection with the restoration of Westminster Hall I see on refer to Class that the sum of have be spend up to the end of last year and a further sum of up to the of March make a total of or together with the sum now ask for a total of As no provision be make for railing or for lay down the in closure around the new building I presume that we shall be ask for a further sum on that account Therefore I think I be correct in say that before the work be complete we shall have expend a sum more nearly approach than Now it appear to me that the Committee may approach the Vote with a perfectly free and open mind It be quite true that a Committee be appoint to consider the question in that it present a Report and that in July a discussion take place in this House upon that Report But in the first place the Committee be appoint under very different circumstance from those which now exist I wish to disclaim most emphatically that this Vote have any connection with the side of the House on which I now sit and if I be sit on the other side of the House support Her Majesty Government I should object to it in precisely the same way Indeed I believe that the Amendment I propose to move will have the support of many Members on the other side of the House There be no Party feeling whatever in the matter but the simple question be whether we approve of the work which be now be carry out and particularly to one portion of them to which I shall allude before I sit down I would like the Committee to look a little close to this Select Committee and it Report It be appoint in and consist of Members most of them of high position The term of the reference be to examine and report upon plan for the restoration of the exterior of Westminster Hall I lay considerable stress upon the word exterior There be lay before the Committee a scheme which it be suggest would cost but that include the addition of two corner tower at the north end of the Hall which proposal be apparently even too strong for the stomach of the Committee It be therefore ruthlessly cut out and leave a sum of a the estimated cost of the work which the Committee approve of As the work be likely to cost it be not too much to say that they will exceed the Estimate by nearly per cent The expenditure up to Saturday last be we be ask to vote or against without the sum that will be necessary to complete the in closure and rail The proceeding of the Committee be very interesting and occupy a considerable volume The Committee wind up their Report with the observation that this be a most difficult subject I can only wish that the Committee and the right Member for Bradford Shaw who be mainly responsible for it have proceed a little more judiciously in what they admit to be a difficult subject The Vote come on for discussion in this House on the of July and it underwent considerable criticism It be point out that the money obtain in August be ask for under a certain plea and that it have not be apply to the purpose for which it be ask namely strengthen and preserve from the weather the fly buttress In the course of the discussion the right Member for Bradford make use of one or two curious expression He say that he have find it not easy to act a Chairman of the Committee and a First Commissioner of Works at the same time and that on the whole he have felt bound to stand by the Architect Therefore we may take it that a Chairman of the Committee he act a counsellor guide and friend of the principal witness and that he do not possess that impartial mind a Chairman of the Committee which be to have be expect To a certain extent he act a Pearson advocate before the Committee Delay be plead for It be point out that it be a moribund House of Commons that a General Election be imminent and that it be not desirable to do more than keep the fly buttress from damage that there be no necessity for hurry the scheme through the House of Commons These argument do not prevail and what occur then may occur again this afternoon Members who have not hear the discussion come into the House when the division bell be rung and give their vote without be cognizant of the merit of the case The Vote be carry and I should like to ask what the public have get for this expenditure something like I will not criticize the outside architectural feature of the scheme but inside we have get a few room badly approach and too far off altogether a most inconvenient arrangement for those who be engage in the business of this House So far a the upper room be concern they be worth little or nothing and upon the basement there be only three or four cellar I can not conceive an arrangement more expose to ridicule There be a covered space for horse but it be approach by a declivity which it be dangerous to drive a horse down But leave the cost of the building and the want of arrangement my specific ground of objection be the work inside Westminster Hall The Committee be appoint to examine and report upon plan for the restoration of the exterior of Westminster Hall If it could have be foreseen that such a structure would have be erect in the middle of Westminster Hall I do not think the money would have be grant in July so readily It be quite evident that the matter of these step be present in the mind of the Select Committee and to show this I will read some of the question put by the Chairman of the Committee to Pearson together with Pearson answer Pearson be ask Question How do you propose to give access to these room By staircase from the Hall Question Is that follow the original plan The original plan at this end point to it and a second flight of step lead up from the south of the Hall and then an additional flight of step towards the centre somewhat similar to the step which exist before in the Hall a may he see in one of the old view Would those step he any detriment to the Hall itself None whatever Supposing exception be take to those step would it be possible to give access to those room in the show in the plan of the low story Certainly it would sacrifice some portion of the upper floor The Conference Room here point to it would have to be diminish in size It would necessitate some little rearrangement of the upper floor Yes But if it be think objectionable to let the staircase be step in the Hall access could easily be obtain in the manner I have suggest Yes step exist a show in No A flight of step be show here Certainly step but not anything like what Pearson have put in Westminster Hall Pearson admit that there would be no difficulty in avoid these step in Westminster Hall and the effect of his examination be that they be not necessary in order to give access to these room But a good deal more occur in reference to the step than that When the matter come on for discussion in this House on the of July the Chairman of the Committee say page It have be object by the Member that the access to these room would partly be by stone staircase in the corner of Westminster Hall foot in height That be undoubtedly how access be give to them in former time It be my intention if I have remain in charge of the Office of Works to try by a model how these would look and whether they would interfere with the appearance of Westminster Hall In the opinion of Pearson they would not detract from the appearance of the Hall If however it should turn out that that be not so and that the effect be have it would he quite possible to place the step in the low part of the Gallery by sacrifice a part of the space there and in this way I think the objection of the Gentleman would be completely meet That I regard a one of the suggestion which we often see throw out from the Treasury Bench to soothe the mind of the objector to a particular Vote and I have no doubt that this be a suggestion make with that object The effect of it be that the objection to the step be allow to sleep the Vote be obtain and hoarding put up so that it be impossible to see what be take place behind them Now that the hoarding have be take down we see the structure expose in all it hideous deformity entirely destroy the vista down the Hall I believe it be quite impossible to show that there be anything like it in bygone day I have be to the British Museum and although the representation of the Hall do not go back very far there be nothing like these step to be find in any old print This be a matter for which I hold no Party responsible but it be a matter for the Committee to take into their own hand and deal with a they think fit The historic glory of this old Hall be or ought to be dear to every Member of this House I say unhesitatingly that these erection mar the grand and severe line of one of the noble hall in this country I ask the Committee to support the Motion I now make that this Vote be reduce by the sum of a a protest against what I can not help characterize a a ruthless act of Vandalism SHAW Bradford Central I be First Commissioner of Works at the time Pearson be employ in the work of restore Westminster Hall and a I act a Chairman of the Committee which my Friend have frequently to I think the Committee will not be surprised if I take up at once the challenge of my Friend My Friend have allude to the Report of the Committee and to my action a Chairman of it I do not propose to detain the Committee at any length upon this somewhat stale subject but I be quite prepared to defend my conduct As First Commissioner of Works I find it necessary to defend Pearson from what I consider at the time to be an unfair attack from a small clique of professional men who have determine to destroy his scheme if they could It be not necessary to go into all the matter which be bring before the Committee but simply to ascertain whether on the whole the result of our action be satisfactory The Member for the Division Ellis say that the upper room of the new building be badly approach and too far off I take issue with him on all of those point I say that they be not ill light nor badly approach Each have a separate approach and it be not the fact that they only communicate with one another Each have a separate communication with the Hall They be not ill light and the building at right angle with the Hall be one of the most noble room to be find in London My Friend say they be worth very little but it appear to me that they be extremely valuable room I have no doubt that great use will be find for them and that they will free other room in this House which may be dedicate to Members in other respect My Friend go on to refer to the staircase and I presume that they form the main object which have induce him to move the reduction of the Vote He have truly say that the question of the staircase be a subject of long discussion both in the Committee and in this House Pearson idea be that he be restore the building on the west front of Westminster Hall as nearly a possible to the condition which he believe to exist from the time of Richard II to a comparatively recent period Unquestionably room similar to those now exist in former time and be approach by staircase from the Hall The Member have throw some doubt upon the fact and say that in his opinion they never have any direct communication with Westminster Hall itself But in the north staircase an old archway can be point out which show that all the room communicate with the Hall in the manner they do now My Friend have refer to the statement which I make when the Report of the Select Committee be discuss in this House that I have intend have I remain First Commissioner to put up model of the propose staircase so that the public might judge of the effect of them That be undoubtedly the fact Now I never set up to be a great authority on matter of taste and I have always be anxious on such matter to take the opinion of the public outside as far a I can and probably Members will recollect that when the plan for the restoration of Westminster Hall be originally make I have a model make of the exterior of the new building so that Members might be able to judge the effect for themselves So far a the staircase be concern notwithstanding all that the Member have say I maintain that they be no detriment whatever to the exist Hall On matter of taste it be advisable that the House should be guide by the best authority of the day and I can give authority which will be recognize a very high authority for the statement I have just make I do not wish to force my on the House I prefer rather to quote the opinion of four men who will be recognize by Members to be the high authority on this subject Waterhouse Christian and Professor Brooks I have have communication from all four gentleman on the subject of the final design of the new building on the side of Westminster Hall and especially on the point of the staircase The first of the four opinion to which I shall refer be I think the most important It be that of a gentleman who have very grave doubt indeed on the subject of the staircase before they be erect Christian have tell me that now he be able to judge the general effect of the staircase his opinion be entirely different to what it be before He say As regard the interior of the Hall and the new staircase I be thankful to say that the dread with which I at one time look forward to their introduction have be entirely dissipate by what I have see The north and south staircase be admirably manage and the view of the roof of the Hall from the landing of the former and of Stephen Hall from a similar position on the latter would alone compensate for any obstruction if there be any such to defend They be really to an architect eye quite charm The central staircase and the arch beneath it give access to the low series of room be design in the true spirit of a mediaeval mason The outside parapet and the pedestal may be and I think be open to criticism in respect of detail but the main feature be really admirable You be I presume aware that the northern staircase give access to the upper series of room by an ancient doorway admirably restore and complete by Pearson without disturb the inner ring of the arch which give clear and strong evidence to the truthfulness of his theory of restoration Waterhouse write The staircase lead from the Hall be very well contrive not take up much room and yet by their variety add interest and scale to that side of the Hall The only doubt I have be a regard the central staircase and that be with reference to the four pedestal terminate the side wall of the court flight They appear to me too high and unnecessarily interfere with the view of the beautiful arch support the upper flight The staircase would in my opinion have be well worth build if only for the new and unexpected view they afford of the Hall itself The northern one have utilize the freshly English doorway and enable the spectator to see the Hall from probably the most favourable point of view The central one allow of the examination of the detail of the roof in a way impossible from below while the southern staircase carry one into a corner of the Hall from whence be a fascinating view of the entrance to Stephen Hall Professor Brooks say Never before have I see the Great Hall look so well For some cause it look much large this I consider arises from the staircase which project into the Hall and thereby break up the large surface of the west wall and give a scale to the building it so much require So successfully have these staircase be design they form good approach to room they give scale to the building and they do not intrude too much into or obstruct the circulation in the Hall From the landing of these staircase most charming view can be obtain of the Hall itself and of the fine timber roof in England Such view be never obtainable before say The interior of the Hall have certainly be materially improve by the change The west wall be formerly disfigure by six enormous doorway which detract very much from the scale and proportion of the building and have altogether a most disagreeable effect The new doorway and staircase have quite remedied this defect and to my mind form very interesting and please feature on that side of the Hall I say I do not intend to put myself forward a an authority on these matter but hay get such judge a I could and have look at the whole work effect by Pearson I can but conclude that it have be carry out with very great success I can see no defect whatever and I would ask Members who entertain any doubt to reserve their final until the work be complete and they can judge of it a a whole which be the only way to arrive at a fair It be not quite fair to the architect that it should be judge in it incomplete state ELLIS Will the right Gentleman pardon me for interrupt him Is there any more work to be do in Westminster Hall SHAW No I think not ELLIS Then we can judge the effect of the alteration there SHAW It be hardly fair to condemn Pearson on a single piece of his work before the whole result of his building can be see I do not think it would be quite fair to the architect to come to a final on the subject yet I wish I might venture to detain the House with an opinion on the general effect of the restoration All the Reports I have quote speak in enthusiastic term of the way in which the work have be carry out and of the building a a whole and Christian especially say I can not but think that the throw open of the Great Hall and the clothing of it base with massive building thoroughly harmonious with the old work but greatly add to it strength and power a a grand architectural feature be one of the most successful work of modern time It be to me a very real satisfaction to look upon it and I trust most sincerely that in the enclosure of the ground outside nothing will be do that can in any way mar the grand simplicity of a picture which when complete ought to be one of the very fine to be see in London Waterhouse also refer in the same term to the general result of the work I have only again to ask the House not to come to a final on this question it be only fair to the architect that time should be give for the completion of it a a whole I may venture to express my regret that no money have be take in the Estimates for the present year for complete the approach lay out the ground and put railing in front of the enclosure It be hardly fair to the architect when the work be practically complete that it should still be surround by hoard for twelve month and that no opportunity should be afford to the public of view the building I can only conclude by say that in my Pearson have carry out a work of the great difficulty in a most satisfactory manner and I believe the verdict of the architectural world be decisively in favour of what he have do I regard it a a worthy completion of Westminster Hall and a work which will be an honour and dignity to this part of London SIR GEORGE CAMPBELL The right Gentleman have say a great deal about the feeling of the architect but surely there be something to be say for the feeling of the British taxpayer and for the way in which he be tyrannize over by artist and architect I think indeed the great tyranny and the most injurious tyranny that we have to put up with be that which come from the architect He make building which we not only have to pay for but which we have to live in and which affect the comfort of our life for all time to come It seem to me that it be a terrible misfortune to the country that architects look a a rule not to the convenience of the public but seek to gain their artistic end and in case out of design building which be not suitable for the purpose for which they be intend We have only to look for an instance of that to the new Law Courts for which we pay so large a sum of money and which have turn out to be so singularly to the purpose for which they be intend Not only be the architecture bad bat the work be The roof have shrink and be in danger I think we have be grossly lead astray by the architect with regard to the work he have do to the exterior of Westminster Hall Indeed I fear the thing be now past praying for I think a great deal of money have be spend uselessly for the only result so far a I can see be that a number of wretched room have be erect and those room be good for no practical purpose whatever There might have be build a really magnificent room if only the architect have go the right way to work We be prevent from have any knowledge of what be go on by the erection of hoarding around the work and I believe that if the House have have an opportunity of judge what be propose the architect would not have be allow under the cover of the hoarding to erect a hideous staircase I be a modest man but if I pride myself on anything it be that I have a sober mind and be not carry away by passion I be not architecturally or morally drunk I have I repeat a sober mind in matter relate to art and the result of what I have see have be to convince me that matter of high art be all bosh and humbug I do admire the interior of Westminster Hall I believe it be the fine Hall in Europe or at least it be before those awful stair be put in I also believe that the exterior of Westminster Hall be never mean to be otherwise than simple for the reason that it be surround by the kitchen of Royal Palaces and could not be see to advantage I join with my Friend in be shock and disgust with the way in which the Hall have be treat The step which have be put in be not only ridiculously out of harmony with the rest of the building but they be altogether out of proportion and we find they be intend for no possible use whatever but to give access to those wretched little miserable room for which even the right Gentleman the Member for Bradford can find no use whatever I hope the Members of this House will exercise their common sense will put a stop to these proceeding and will have the stair remove and I therefore heartily support my Friend and certainly decline for myself to be tyrannize over by architect CAVENDISH Whitehaven I have hop Sir that the First Commissioner of Works would have follow the right Gentleman the Member for Bradford in this debate and have give the Committee his view in regard to this matter Since he have not do so I desire now Sir to state the reason which induce me to support the Amendment I be afraid the House be now commit to this expenditure and that it be of no use try to overthrow it But when I be a Member of the Committee deal with this question I express an opinion that if the First Commissioner of Works employ Pearson he would be pretty sure to find himself in a mess because Pearson and his school do not follow the idea of the old master We have now see the result of Pearson work These be no doubt all question of taste but my doctrine have always be to follow the old master because they be right Pearson and his school of course thought that the idea which they adopt be good than those of the old master and they act accordingly My opinion be that either the magnificent design of Sir Charles Barry should be complete or the matter should be let alone until a future time Instead of that the right Gentleman decide to employ Pearson With regard to the outside of Westminster Hall we be commit to the work there We protest against them in but we be overrule and now we must make the best we can of the building But the inside of the Hall be an entirely new question I do not believe that the design for the step be ever submit to the Committee and there be no evidence to show that they be The plan be nothing but a mere ground plan and there be nothing in it to show this large erection which so far a I can see be a copy of the pulpit use by Then there be another great defect about the alteration in Westminster Hall and that be their want of symmetry I should like to know why the doorway be not make exactly opposite to the entrance to Stephen cloister Then again there be the roughness of the western wall I think it be most unsightly and that it destroy the whole harmony of the southern end of Westminster Hall There be another defect in this new arrangement One idea of the class of architect to which Pearson belong seem to be that you must not have anything smooth and sightly to the eye but that you must go back to some barbarous period and that you must make everything rough and unsightly SHAW Bradford Central Does the right Gentleman refer to the interior or the exterior wall CAVENDISH I refer to the exterior wall between these famous staircase The new architect have roughen the whole face of the western wall and it present a very unsightly appearance No doubt the architect have be fill with the idea that they be go to put something there which be there originally but there be nothing to show that Pearson restoration be anything but the creation of his own mind I do not think that the authority who have be quote in support of this work be such a the Committee ought to follow No one who can put two and two together will fail to see that the staircase will interfere with the whole idea of the Hall The Champions of England be accustom in former day to ride into the Hall if the Champions of England rode into it now I think it would be difficult for them to get out on the other side The staircase be nothing but obstruction and be not necessary even for the purpose of obtain access to the small door at the end Then there be a parapet at the end which I hope will be remove My reason for vote for the Amendment be that these particular staircase and the alteration on the whole have never be sanction by the Committee and be therefore open to the decision of the House upon them and we shall be quite justify in reduce the Vote to show our sense of the wrong that have be do to Westminster Hall Southwark I cordially support the Motion of my Friend the Member for Ellis I think we can very freely express our deep regret that the present Chief Commissioner do not in accept the advice give to him in this House not to hastily adopt Pearson proposal The grumbling we hear would not I think have be hear if the right Gentleman have not be too anxious I think through courtesy to adopt the plan of his right Predecessor in office Shaw I think Courtney you yourself state pretty clearly what would happen if this new building be erect You say the outer room would be nothing but cellar to which people would have to descend from Westminster Hall by mean of a flight of step that the inner portion of the Hall would be more or less disfigured and that the outside building would serve no possible purpose but that of darken the interior of the Hall The right Gentleman Shaw have talk a good deal about style and about architect but what I say in I say now namely that he have think more about style than utility What we need be to have some useful building erect in order that the business of Parliament may be more conveniently conduct The right Gentleman appear to have give no instruction at all to Pearson a to the requirement of the House He merely instruct him to prepare plan which he approve and get the Government of the day to approve and then have them refer to a Select Committee with an altogether insufficient reference Even the right Gentleman Shaw have no idea a to what use the room be to be apply The Select Committee state in their Report that when they commence their inquiry the only plan before them be those of Pearson I hope even that we shall have some declaration from the First Commissioner that the very ugly step which everybody disapprove of will be remove and I think we must also ask him to state for what purpose the room be go to be use The right Gentleman Shaw say that there be a separate entrance to every room but in order to get to the separate entrance you have to pass through other room SHAW I venture to say without fear of contradiction that you can approach every room through Westminster Hall without pass through other room Well I go there with an Friend and I have be there before and I certainly think that you can not do so I have protest before against these plan and I protest again I only hope that the First Commissioner of Works will be able to say something that will cheer u up on the subject DE LISLE Leicestershire Mid I hope the Committee will allow me to give my reason why I can not support this Amendment I take very great interest in Westminster Hall and if it be possible to have reconsider the whole question and to have carry rat Sir Barry plan I think it would have be wise to do so That be an impossibility a thing now be and I think it be a great misfortune that when something be be do with the authority of this House and be approach completion an attempt should be make to undo what have be do I have no doubt that if any mediaeval architect have have to put these step into the Hall he would have place them symmetrically opposite the entrance to this House The modern idea that eccentricity be a great feature of mediaeval architecture be an one Whenever symmetry be depart from in such architecture it be do from necessity and not from choice I think that the general effect of Westminster Hall have not be damage by the addition which have be make to it With regard to the roughening of the wall I hold that the treating of the wall in that manner give a pretty variation of light and shade and be much superior to leave it smooth I can not vote for this Amendment because I earnestly desire to see Westminster Hall complete When it be complete it will then I think be time to consider whether any alteration should be make in it I think the great window on the north side which look a bare and cold a possible ought to be fill with stained glass My right Friend the First Commissioner of Works have inform me that the cost of fill it with stained glass would not exceed and I do hope that next year if the right Gentleman have the courage to put this down in the Estimates he will ask Parliament to grant that sum It might be make a window commemorative of Her Majesty Jubilee and I would suggest that the arm of Her Majesty and of all the Sovereigns who come to take part in the Jubilee Service should figure in it There be other window also which need a little colour so a to brighten up the Hall The shield also run round the Hall be at one time resplendent with gold and colour a be also the shield bear by the carved angel in the roof It would not cost much to repaint and them so a to give a bright line of colour round the Hall I think also the glass panel in the north door of the Hall might be fill in so a to make the door all solid wood work You would then have the grand effect of a dark dado run round the Hall and the splendour and dignity of the building would be much increase If I might make a few remark about the great Central Lobby it seem to me it would be a good thing if the statue of Lord and Lord John Russell be move into Westminster Hall At present they be completely out of place because a different standard of symmetry be give by the statuary in the moulding lead up to the which give a scale of elegance and dignity to the Central Hall unequalled by any other hall in Europe They might at present stand at the top of the first flight of step I be sure that the public be anxious to see this building which be essentially the people palace complete and I hope that the Representatives of the people will endeavour to bring about this result I hope the task will not be approach in a niggardly manner and that this which be the glory of our nation will be properly complete HERBERT GARDNER Essex Saffron Walden I can not say I agree with the criticism of my Friend the Member for Sir Campbell that the high art of this century be all bosh and humbug but I must say that if the present interior of Westminster Hall be an example of the high art of this century I should be very much of the opinion of my Friend a to the value of that art My right Friend the Member for Bradford Shaw urge that we should reserve our opinion on this subject but my right Friend subsequently admit that the interior of the Hall be practically complete and it be to the interior of the Hall that we specially object What we chiefly complain of be this staircase which I regard a nothing less than hideous and also the blank space on the of the Hall which balance so ill the iron screen on the opposite side and be altogether a perfect eyesore I do not set myself up a a judge of taste but I know what I think be ugly and I know what I think be pretty I be not go to be guide therefore in a matter of this kind by any number of architect or any amount of architect opinion I be certain that if Gentlemen have be able to see how hideous the present interior of Westminster Hall be go to be they would have do everything they could when the plan be under discussion to prevent their adoption I shall certainly support the Amendment Aberdeenshire W I quite agree with the right Gentleman the Member for Bradford that the Committee which sit on this subject be a good one and certainly one member of it have a kind of prophetic insight into what be to happen The only Gentleman who really understand the plan namely Dick predict very accurately a great many of the grave defect which would be find in this building I think a study of the report of the Committee throw a lurid light upon what be state by the right Gentleman the Member for Bradford namely that we should subordinate our own taste and feeling entirely to the taste and opinion of architect When we invite the opinion of expert we find them hopelessly at variance some will be one side and a many on the other side and so we find in this instance architects on one side and on the other But what strike me in regard to the opinion of those Gentlemen quote by the right Member for Bradford be if I may use an expression which I hope be not that they damn the work with very faint praise Everyone have some amount of qualification of his commendation the step be good but something else be wrong This only bear out my view that you may find expert on both side of any question of this kind I should like to know whether an attempt have be make to get the opinion of any other architect for I feel sure that we should not want the support of professional opinion to our view that these step be an outrage to one of the fine old hall in the world I be not go to take the sweeping line take by some I Members who have speak for I be of opinion that the outside work on Westminster Hall be good in design and thoroughly in harmony with the rest of the building So far a my go Pearson have there be quite successful but when we get inside my favourable opinion cease Any man familiar with the appearance of the Hall will agree that the stair be not beautiful in themselves and place a they be they break up the fine majestic sweep of that side of the Hall and spoil the grand simplicity of the whole I confess I have be unable to find the separate entrance for the room and I wish the right Gentleman Shaw would organize a personally conduct tour and explain this to u I be there and I could find no trace of such thing As say long ago the arrangement be inconvenient if there should be anything like a crowd enter these room and the room will be subject to unpleasant odour from below I do not know what the room be mean for but I suppose for the use of Members of Parliament If that be so if Members be likely to be there at all you must have some machinery by which they may have an intimation of a division in the House and it be hardly possible to get from those room in time to take part in a division without run an exercise for which the habit and physical conformation of many Members be Even now it be difficult to get from the Committee Rooms upstairs to this House in time when a division be call We sometimes hear of fatal consequence to elderly gentleman from run to catch train and I suppose if something of the kind happen to some of u something will be do to obviate the necessity of proceed at a headlong pace It strike me look at the new room that the old Law Courts might as well have be save I remember too the staircase be unobtrusive and something like the staircase of old time no more obtrusive and no more interfered with the architectural appearance of the Hall than the old orange woman who keep her stall in the corner To compare these clumsy stair to the light flight of stair that lead up to those picturesque doorway a I remember they be be an outrage on common sense It be a great pity I think the old Law Courts be not keep they be quite as convenient a room the architecture be not much bad and preserve them would have save a large sum of money I shall give my support to the Motion of my Friend Northampton We adopt the usual course in regard to our public building We leave the matter to the Chief Commissioner and a professional architect and they have make a thorough mess of it There be an idea I believe when at considerable expense a number of room be provide that they would be so many extra Committee room Now we have to come to the conclusion that they will not be use for Committee room nor do I see how they could be see that they open one into the other No Will the Member allow me to correct the statement I make just now that to go to one room you must pass through another That would be so if you go up the centre staircase but I find this can be avoid by descend the centre staircase and ascend others at each end of the Hall and a regard the basement I find that there be a hole on the ground floor that if not fill up can be make the mean of access from outside the building to the corner room The real fact be there be no present intention to use these a Committee Rooms for you can not pass from one to the other without come down one staircase into Westminster Hall and ascend another a most inconvenient arrangement more especially when witness and counsel and agent be require to attend to matter in more than one room The only possible use to which I can see the room can be put be to use them a a sort of prison for those Members who happen to offend the House and who if mow imprison by way of punishment be send to the Clock Tower to the great injury to their health from the noise of the clock We have build the room at considerable expenditure of money but I do not suppose we be prepared to pull them down again but with these staircase it be a different thing They be a great eyesore So far a I know the right Gentleman the Member for Bradford and the architect he have mention be the only people who admire them There be a consensus of opinion that these staircase ought to come away and the simple course be to take them away we can get into the room without them by put a staircase in the little room lead up to these Committee Rooms It be too late to argue about the room but at least these objectionable stair might be take away FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS Dublin University I must ask the Committee to bear with me while I endeavour to deal with the many argument address to me on this matter of the restoration of Westminster Hall by Pearson I notice in the first place that whereas the criticism a few year ago be very loud and very uncompromising a regard the effect which would be produce by proposed addition to the exterior of the Hall on the present occasion those criticism have hardly be hear at all I think I may say have be in communication with many people on the subject inside and outside the House of Commons that at last there be an almost universal consensus of opinion a to the excellence of Pearson work on the outside at all event and a to his have make a substantial and handsome addition to the general appearance of the old Hall The Committee be no doubt aware there be a necessity for some such work be do in order to preserve the wall the roof and the flying buttress which be in a state which cause considerable anxiety and I may say at once that the main reason why it become necessary to make a considerable addition to the Estimate formerly before the House be that when the matter come to be examine it be find that the fly buttress be in a much more advanced stage of decay than have be suppose and it be find essential to renew the old work to a great extent than have be anticipate That I think further show the urgent necessity there be for take the work in hand if the old Hall be to be preserve at all Another reason for increase the Estimate be that a very elaborate and complete system of ventilation have be provide under the direction of our distinguish adviser Percy for the new building and it be find necessary in order to meet the requirement in this respect to give further support to the wall and fly buttress This account for the great part of the increase in the Estimate And now let me say a word or two about the staircase Of course after all it be a matter of taste but so far a I have be able to judge there be nothing like such a universal consensus of opinion a the Member for Northampton say against these staircase There be some people who say they do not make much difference and others notably the distinguish architect to which the right Gentleman have refer and many others speak to the same effect declare that they add greatly to the beauty of the Hall One thing be certain that any person who walk up the centre staircase and look around will get a much good view of the Hall than he can get from any other part of the building except perhaps from the wide flight of step at the end of the Hall However this be a matter of taste and I be not anxious dogmatically to press my own opinion but I think that any Member of the Committee who be not an architect will probably agree with me that he have seldom see a change make in any old building which do not at first produce on him the effect of a surprise if not of a shock but that have get over the surprise of the change he will some time come to the opinion that the result do after all justify the change But I do not press that view too far It be I repeat a matter of taste And let me say in pass that when one have to stand the criticism differ so widely a those of my right Friend the Member for White haven who have devote much study to the old master and be always ready with a particular affirmative and the Member for whose on art result be a universal negative and who would study utility alone it must be admit that any Chief Commissioner will always have a considerable number of assailant in reference to the carry out of any architect plan I have myself little doubt that if the step be remove and other step be put in their place or if no step at all be erect there would be another cloud of witness to raise objection to the new arrangement I have best I think under these circumstance fall back upon the strong Committee which report in on these plan after go fully into the subject That Committee have before them the architect and his plan and it member have every opportunity of him and ventilate their own view I must remind Members that the Committee of after go into the matter most carefully and occupy sit after sit during several month ultimately carry the report upon which the architectural work have be base by majority of seven or eight to two or three in every important division Then it be say these plan be never before the Committee at all but there I say Members be entirely mistake Not only have they these plan and in which the three staircase be plainly show but they have No which give a section of the staircase at the northern end of the Hall CAVENDISH Only a sectional elevation I be speak of that It be show a a sectional elevation of the northern end of the Hall I admit that the double staircase in the middle of the Hall be not show CAVENDISH Hear hear But that be merely a duplication of the staircase at the north end of the Hall All it characteristic will be find in the elevation give and there be a I have already state before the Committee a ground plan of what be to be do in which the three staircase be plainly show It be not therefore a true representation to say that these staircase be not before the Committee and they be necessary for access to the upper room The Member for the Division ask why I do not disclose to the House of Commons and the public the deed of darkness which be be do behind the wooden screen I be not very long First Commissioner of Works after the debate on this subject in but when I return to the office I be ask a question on the of September about two of these flight of stair and my answer be certainly no I state that The scheme which have be sanction by the House include the erection of two open flight of step have projection not of foot and foot respectively a state in the question but of foot inch and foot inch respectively Plights of step fulfil the same object a those now propose and occupy very similar position have exist in Westminster Hall very nearly throughout it whole history And then I go on to explain that Pearson plan be a modern reproduction of what exist in ancient time I speak of two staircase the question address to me have reference to two staircase only and I only cite this answer to show that I fully explain to the House what be go on behind the mysterious screen What the House be really interested I think to know however be what use be to be make of the room we have thus acquire Some such building be necessary for preserve the old Hall from ruin but I think they might be make extremely useful I entirely differ from the estimate which have be form of the room by some Members They have more light than the room in which many of the officer of this House have to sit every day One be a very large and handsome room and even if not large enough for a Grand Committee it would do for a Committee of very considerable size The other room I venture to think could be turn to well account than a Committee Rooms My idea be in the first place to transfer into those room which be certainly at an inconvenient distance from the House for Members wish to attend Divisions the Private Bill Office at present run along the side of Stephen Hall The clerk of that office would not complain of the difficulty of access to the room for instead of have only one access a they have to their present room they would have five I would also suggest that it would be well to transfer the officer of the Journal Office who have room face on to the terrace to these new room which be quite a large and as well ventilate and light a those they now occupy There be no doubt that the accommodation at present in the House for interview stranger and deputation be extremely small and my idea be that the room along the side of Stephen Hall would be a very convenient place for Members to meet deputation and to see stranger or their private secretary With respect to the room face on the terrace it have often be represent to me that more smoking accommodation be desirable and I propose therefore to convert one of these room into a second smoking room I do not bring forward these idea dogmatically and I would be glad of suggestion from Members a to the disposal of the room But it be I believe a sound principle to utilize the new room for the officer of the House whose immediate closeness to the House itself be not essential and to take advantage of the room which they now occupy for the great comfort and convenience of Members themselves On the whole I can see no reason for take a step so strong a that of abolish the staircase Let Members give them a fair trial and see what the general opinion will be I be in favour of open Westminster Hall to the public if the Home Secretary come to the conclusion a I have reason to hope he will that it be possible again to do so ELLIS I thank the right Gentleman for his explanation I be sure we shall all be glad to know that these new room will be put to a reasonable practical use The object with which I move this reduction be to protest against the step in Westminster Hall I ask the of the Committee simply and solely in regard to the work do inside the Hall Wilts One objection that have be make to the step be that they destroy the symmetry of the Hall and that Gothic architects always study symmetry The Gentleman opposite who state this forgot that the Gothic architect first consider what be want and in carry out what be necessary studied symmetry if it be convenient but if not defy it and still build what be beautiful No building could more aptly illustrate this than this historic Hall The central doorway be not in the centre Six windows flank it on one side five on the other and the buttress and arch on the West side be unsymmetrical with the window and with each other No Courtney the thing be do and the staircase be build though not yet finish They may look good then and to alter them will cost a great deal more money and probably at the further cost of convenience I do not admire them but I can not say they be ugly They be necessary and a in Gothic architecture regard be always pay to the practical necessity of the case at as little sacrifice of beauty a possible and a the step be pay for I think we have well keep them awhile and see how they chime in with the old building when they be finish I shall certainly vote against the Amendment HOWELL Green With regard to that part of the criticism which have be hurl at the head of Pearson the architect a to the stone use in the new work not have a smooth face I would point out that if it have a smooth face it would be altogether out of character in the building The stone refer to have what be technically call a tooled surface and accord with the face of the stone use throughout the building DE LISLE Leicestershire Mid I wish to urge upon the Government the desirability of remove the close up dormer window on the eastern slope of the roof of Westminster Hall and of complete the timber of the roof in uniformity with the western slope The alteration I be inform would not cost more than and it be surely a disgrace to the nation that we can not afford to retain and restore both slope of the roof which be renowned throughout the world a the fine specimen of ancient timber work the effect of which be completely destroy at night when the hall be light up by these ugly hole in the eastern slope I do hope the Government will next year ask for sufficient money to complete the roof at least for the king or ancient Abbots of Westminster would never have tolerate for six month such a miserable exhibition of national penury SIR CAMPBELL The first notice of Amendment I have on the Paper be render unnecessary by that we have just dispose of but I will move my second Amendment a a protest against the excess ask for over the Estimate for the restoration of Westminster Hall and a a protest against the lofty manner in which the right Gentleman the First Commissioner of Works reply to criticisms upon that excess There be nothing more objectionable than this constant practice on the part of architect and engineer of give u an estimate in the first instance and then lead u into enormous excess There seem to me no excuse for excess in this case the question have be for year before the House and the architect have have every facility for perfect his plan and complete his estimate on a reasonable basis Whereas the original estimate for this work be some the actual cost have be and before the railing be finish the amount will probably rise to If the architect be a capable and efficient a man a he be say to be why do he not prepare a capable and honest estimate and let u know at once the amount to be expend I move to reduce the vote by CAVENDISH and I wish to ask my right Friend the First Commissioner of Works whether any step have be or be be take to put the contract of this building under one authority We have be tell that the building be under the Lord Great Chamberlain and that it be owe to that functionary that the Statue to the late Lord have be put up in the central hall THE CHAIRMAN The subject the right Gentleman be go into be relative neither to the item under discussion nor to the reduction which have be move Walworth I be inform that the Vote last take be on a Motion to reduce the salary of the architect by to which I be opposed and I wish most emphatically and decidedly to say that I go into the wrong Lobby I can not support the reduction of the Vote now propose for the work have be do and a honest men we must pay for it but I must say that I think the staircase very objectionable and that the architect appear to have utterly fail to catch the spirit of the design of the Hall THE CHAIRMAN That question have already be discuss I beg to move the reduction of the Vote under Item C by the sum of and in do so if what I have to say be not new the fault be not mine but that of the First Commissioner of Works For the last three year I have bring this question before the House and I hope that the House will not this year turn a deaf ear to the prayer of the workman whose case I represent I be sure that the First Commissioner of Works be not desirous of continue to do them an injustice and I hope that he have give to the subject the attention he promise me last year a I think we be now entitle to a distinct promise that the system of which I complain and under which the workman be subject to severe hardship should be speedily terminate The right Gentleman promise to inquire I want to know what be the result of his inquiry and what be go to be do I do not complain that new work or extensive alteration in connection with the Houses of Parliament should be execute by ordinary contract but what I do protest against be the extraordinary system of contract for human labour and allow some one to deduct from the wage of the men a considerable portion of the sum which we vote in this House year by year I be told that this system have prevail for some year and that nobody know how it come about The present contractor be Brass Some of the workman be contract for at the rate of per hour and others at the rate of very small sum a great deal too small But out of these sum small a they be the contractor be allow to deduct per hour so that the workman only receive and The work itself be often of a dangerous character a the men have frequently to mount ladder to clean and paint part of the building and foot above the ground That men so employ should be pay at so low a rate be little short of a public scandal These men be also deprive of many advantage which the of the Board of Works enjoy They work long hour they have no holiday except Easter Whit Monday and Christmas Day and they be not allow even a day wag if owe to indisposition they be unable to work Another evil be the confusion which arise from the dual control One body of men be engage by the Board of Works and receive every farthing of the sum vote by this House whereas the men whose cause I represent be not Government servant but be under the control of the contractor As the Government have a Clerk of Works here I think it be most desirable that the whole of the should be under his control The Clerk of the Works receive a salary of or I do not complain of that a an extravagant sum but I do think that he ought to superintend the work of all the men who be employ about this building No one seem to have trouble himself about the grievance of these poor workman or their trouble would have be end long ago Personally I have a very deep sympathy for a class to which I have have the pleasure of belong all my life The present arrangement be that the contractor be suppose to supply certain plant and material such a step trestle and ladder and for that he be allow to make these deduction Surely the nation be wealthy enough to purchase it own plant and material so that the workman shall receive the full rate of wage vote to them by this House It be say that this be an economical arrangement but if so why be it only apply to the poor class of and not to the upper class official who receive high salary Her Majesty Government not long ago appoint a Committee to inquire into the Sweating System but that system they themselves be guilty of encourage by allow work to be do at the Houses of Parliament and other public building in the manner I have indicate Unless a satisfactory assurance be give that the system of which I complain shall be end when the present contract expire I shall be under the necessity of take a Division and I shall go on peg away until the evil complained of be remedied I move the reduction of the Vote by Northampton The matter may be a small one to Members of the House but it be a very important one to the men concern There might be something to be say for the system if it apply to all the workman employ about these building but the House have a Clerk of the Works and other official who could be charge with the duty of employ sweeper The system adopt come very near to sweat The Government pay an hour but the workman only receive The contractor profit of an hour have not to meet any expense for tool or material because all these be provide at the expense of the House It be compute that the contractor net a profit of on the sweeping of the Houses of Parliament alone and he have other contract of a similar kind for the sweeping of public office which can not be discuss under this Vote I do think that under our very nose we ought not to allow this system to prevail When the Government pay an hour it ought to see that the money go into the pocket of the men who do the work Then again we talk of long hour yet here we have men employ from in the morning until half past in the evening and hour or deduct the dinner hour ten hour It be quite evident that the work be excessive and the pay too low I can quite understand that the contract already enter into must run out but it may fairly be ask that such contract shall not be enter into again and that official of the House should employ the labour required Finsbury I wish to endorse the strong opinion which have be express by my Friend the Member for and also his appeal to the First Commissioner to accede to his request I confess that I be astound when I first heard of the system under which the cleaning of this House be provide for I could not believe it possible that while the majority of the official connect with this House be engage directly through the Office of Works or some other Government Department a system of contract for the cleaning at a low price should be tolerate together with the principle of make deduction from the wage of the workman The contractor profit on the labour of each man amount to something like a week a very large sum indeed and it be most discreditable that such large deduction should be make from the wage of the unfortunate workman I do not think that the First Commissioner can possibly for any length of time refuse to listen to the appeal which my Friend make to him I do hope that this House at least will set an example against anything which can be consider in the nature of sweat We be not ask that a large sum of money shall be squander or that any extra charge whatever shall be incur If it be necessary to effect economy it can be do by cut down some of the high salary by a few hundred Let the doctrine of supply and demand be apply to all grade of the public service and then something like real economy may be effect No doubt these men stand in a different position from the workman employ in other department and they will not compare favourably with men employ to do work of a similar character elsewhere I do not think any Member can give a reason why these men should be leave in this condition and why they should not be bring in direct contact with the Chief Commissioner King County I think the First Commissioner be entitle to some sympathy and commiseration at the hand of the House because he have succeed to a system over which he have no initial control This system of contract exist long before the right Gentleman enter into office and I presume that he have felt himself bound to continue matter a he find them Therefore there be no blame to be attach to the right Gentleman himself for the state of affair which now exist but on the other hand we have to look at the matter a a question of principle By appoint a Royal Commission Parliament have set it face against the put of an unjust tax on the earnings of the working class and therefore the First Commissioner may fairly be ask to look into the matter and see what can be do in the future The deduction make in this case amount to per cent of the earnings and that be nearly the maximum of the case that have be bring before the Committee on Sweating It be surely work in which the intervention of a be quite unnecessary We have our own Clerk of the Works who be quite capable of see that the cleaning be do without the intervention of a contractor Therefore by employ a contractor we be guilty of robbery of the earnings of the workman to the extent of per cent Surely the right Gentleman will tell u that the question be worth look into and will provide when the present contract be terminate that these intermediary shall be get rid of STUART I think that we ought to have a more definite assurance from the right Gentleman than that which have be suggest and unless we receive it we ought to go to a Division The system ought to be definitely put a stop to as soon a the exist contract come to an end That be what we should press for and unless a distinct understanding be come to I hope my Friend will press the Motion to a Division This question be raise in Committee on a former occasion and also by a Memorial which have be send to me I have consider it as carefully a I could and I should be glad if I be able to remove the inequality complain of The general system of get our work do through contractor have always be regard a successful hitherto and the only exception to that system be the and furniture men employ in this House These particular be not employ in any other public build Then of course we have to consider the most economical way of do the work but I be perfectly willing on the termination of the contract to give the subject further consideration and no doubt by that time we shall have the result of investigation which be be make into the whole question of the employment of middleman in such case I believe it would be impossible to give the distinct pledge I be ask for Northampton There be no doubt a difficulty about give the specific pledge ask for by the Mover of the Amendment But I should have like to have hear besides a promise to consider this subject some condemnation of what do seem to me a system which require an explicit condemnation in this House The wage of these poor men be very low and you can easily get enough of starve men to compete for employment But that be not a reason it seem to me from what have be allege by the right Gentleman for continue this system of contract I could understand if there be a difficulty in these men receive their wage direct from the Office of Works but it seem possible that they could do so Although it be perfectly true that while the exist contract include this House and other public building continue it may be impossible for the Commissioner of Works to deal with these men I do think that the Chief Commissioner would be well advised if he would allow the good nature of his own character to influence him and say that he would rather look at it from the point of view of these poor men than from the point of view of middleman who in this case be unnecessary I would suggest to my Friend not to press the Amendment to a Division and would urge the Chief Commissioner to put more of the good nature personal to himself and less of his office into the investigation of this matter I do not ask the right Gentleman merely to look into this matter and do nothing I ask him to investigate it with the view to make an alteration The reason give by him for maintain this system of intermediary or contractor be that the work be do cheaply I go to this extent and say that even though the work cost more than it do now we who be condemn sweat in every other department of life be bind to put an end to it in our own case There be a margin of under maintenance and repair Now per cent be deduct from the earnings of these men amount to about Well you have this and you have to employ a superior Clerk of the Works to carry out repair and maintenance without go into a system of sweat a you be now I would point out that in voting for the Government in this matter you be vote for the system of sweat No It be of no use say No The right Gentleman have admit that it be the sweat system No Will the right Gentleman say that deduct per cent out of a man wag be not sweat Twenty per cent be the maximum in a number of accusation of sweat bring before the Royal Commissioners and I be entitle to say that in voting for the Government you be vote for the system of sweat I think the statement of the Chief Commissioner unsatisfactory though I quite admit the difficulty of his position Those who refuse to vote for the Motion of my Friend will have to answer for do so in another place All I have undertake to do be simply this that when the contract conclude I will look carefully into the matter If the House of Commons be of opinion that these men should no longer be employ under the present system of contract I shall gladly endeavour to give the decision effect but it must be do distinctly a the act of the House of Commons In my position a a custodian of the public purse so far a my office be concern it be my duty to endeavour to get the work do as cheaply a possible consistently with efficiency I have give an undertaking to go carefully into the matter and I can not go far Monmouth Courtney the explanation of the right Gentleman be unsatisfactory This be not the first time this question have be ventilate in the House of Commons The right Gentleman himself have be consider it for month and what we want from him be a distinct statement of what be his own of the grievance of these men We do not ask him to point out the remedy now but we ask him whether he think a wage of and per hour subject to per cent and per cent reduction be satisfactory If it be and unfair payment then this House and not the contractor ought to do it own dirty work by pay these men the low wage instead of pay the contractor the full wage We should like to know the right Gentleman own in this matter and whether he think the grievance establish I can amplify the remark of the Gentleman who have just speak by state that the reduction of the wage of these men be just double what be ordinarily allow The ordinary profit of a private builder or contractor be per cent and I fail to see when we come to these poor men that they should be subject to just double the reduction I venture to make this observation to the right Gentleman because I be sure he will give the whole matter his earnest consideration If the contract system be continue there ought to be a stipulation that the reduction of the men wage should not be great than per cent But the right Gentleman would do well to notice the feeling of the House that the whole system should be change and that these men should come under the actual control of the Office of Works WEBSTER Pancras East Gentlemen opposite appear to contend that all work do by contract or by must inevitably be do under what be know a the sweat system Such a contention be to my mind ridiculous A great deal of work in this country be do in all industry by contract and in nearly every instance the workman receive a fair day wage for a fair day work not invariably however and that be what we want to remedy a a consequence of this inquiry into the sweating system But do the workman always give a fair day work for a fair day wage Not always I think To give an instance Westminster Hall be include in this Vote A few month ago I pass by Westminster Hall with a friend and we notice the proverbial man and a boy on the roof nominally at work slat the roof but practically idle their time away we pass again in four hour and they be still engage in laboriously do nothing I very much doubt if one slate have be affix during the time Now if we do away with the contracting system and the work be do under the control of a Clerk of the Works appoint by the First Commissioner of Works it will be needful to see that the country get it fair day work for a fair day wage For the interest of the taxpayer that ought to be see to If that be satisfactorily see to I do not see that it make much difference whether the work be do by contract or not The right Gentleman opposite have be talk of the outside of the building when he might have say something more appropriate with regard to the interior I do not see that the right Gentleman have improve the case which have be put from this side of the House He have not deny the fact that per cent be deduct from the men wage which be what I call sweat pure and simple Let u have no mincing of term with regard to this question it be one on which we ought to express a clear and definite opinion We have to thank the Member for Walworth for what he have say with regard to the contract a it exist but we ought to ask for a distinct expression of opinion on the part of the right Gentleman the First Commissioner of Works that the principle on which that contract be be carry out should cease to be observe when the contract be at an end What be ask be that those who be employ in the work you be contract for should be put in the position of get for themselves the per hour you be pay I think the time have come when a decision may fairly be arrive at I have already state that at the termination of the present contract I will undertake that this whole matter shall be most carefully consider It be for the House of Commons to say how it work should be do and whatever decision the House of Commons arrives at I will of course endeavour to carry out Beyond this it be impossible for me to offer any pledge The right Gentleman opposite twelve month ago make a promise that be quite a clear and definite a that which he have make therefore we know what be mean by the consideration he propose to give to the matter The fact be that we be leave in the same state of indefiniteness a that in which we be place a year since and unless the right Gentleman will give u a distinct promise not only that he will seriously consider the matter but that as far a he be concern for he can not bind his successor he will pledge himself not to renew any contract such a that which be now object to I shall insist on go to a Division so that it may be clearly understood that our action on this Vote be an earnest protest against the sweating system I should like to avoid a Division if it be possible to do so The right Gentleman have say that of his own motion he can not alter the present system but that it be necessary if any alteration be to be make that it should be by a Resolution of this House He be merely an executive officer and have to carry out the contract system which he find lay down for him It seem to me however that the matter we be now discuss be one in regard to which the right Gentleman might well make the alteration we ask for If he do not want to compromise the position of the men by what might be an unfortunate Division he might offer some sort of assurance set forth not only that he have the right to make an alteration at the end of the contract but that he will do so if he find that the general feeling of the House be in favour of that course I have already say that if it be the wish of a majority of the House that an alteration should be make in the system under which the work be now carry on I will at the termination of the contract give effect to that view STUART This be a good opportunity for enforce the view of the House in regard to the sweating system and I trust that that view will be clearly and unmistakably express I rise to a question of order Courtney Before the Member for Queen County proceeds with his Amendment I wish to ask a question upon item Shall I be preclude from do so if the Member now proceed to move to reduce Item D THE CHAIRMAN The Member for Northampton must raise his point now I have already speak to the right Gentleman on the subject but I wish to point out that a very fine picture in this House be be gradually destroy owe to the state of ventilation and I wish to ask if the right Gentleman will consider the best mean of preserve it from absolute destruction I do not want to move any reduction of the Vote all I want be an assurance that the matter shall have attention I be consider the best step to be take to gain the end desire by not only the Member but by all of u I think some of the fresco upstairs be in a very bad and deplorable state Those in the House of Lords be gradually become obscure but I hope the right Gentleman will consider the best mean of utilize decorative art to fill up these panel I have look into the matter and have cause the picture and fresco in the House to be carefully examine I be afraid that some of the fresco upstairs be past praying for I will however again consider the matter Now Courtney I must make an appeal to the Committee to come to a decision on this Vote We have be discuss it nearly four hour and I would point out that if all the Votes be to be discuss at this length we shall take not week but year to get through these Estimates I hope the Committee will now agree to this Vote Sheffield I be very sorry to intervene in this debate The right Gentleman have tell u that many of the fresco be past praying for but in the particular fresco of Herbert CAVENDISH It be not a fresco I wish to point out that it be not in such a bad condition a be generally suppose and it be really worth while spend a minute or two of the House in discuss it I think it be one of the best fresco we have in England If the right Gentleman opposite wish it I will to satisfy him call it a picture I do trust the First Commissioner of Works will think it worth his while to do what he can while the artist yet live to save this valuable picture MACDONALD Queen County In move to reduce Item E by Sir I feel that I be about to discuss a question which involve not only the convenience but the health and even the life of Members of this House and not of the Members only but of the official from the Clerk at the Table down to the humble policeman I consider that the ventilation of this House be simply shock and that our health must suffer if some improvement be not effect in this matter I know that a great deal of money and thought have be expend on the ventilation of the chamber in which we be seat and I be aware that the great difficulty which beset any one who have to deal with this subject arise from the fact that the House be too small to accommodate all it Members I have not sufficient special scientific knowledge to say whether the ventilation of this House be as good a human science can make it but of one thing I be quite convinced and that be that the ventilation of the other portion of this building of the Members lobby of the passage and corridor and of the room allot to the Press be simply disgraceful Now the right Gentleman the First Commissioner of Works be always courteous and he will I be sure tell me what be the exact duty of the officer who have charge of the ventilation of this House and whether it be simply his duty to take care of this Chamber or do he have to look after other portion of the building If he look after the whole of the building he have surely something more to do through himself and his agent than to see that the thermometer always register an equable temperature Why Sir should not some attempt be make to introduce pure air into the entire building I remember the state of thing during the Autumn Session when the atmosphere here be most unhealthy Why be not the window open at time when it would not inconvenience Members Then again I consider the state of thing upstairs most objectionable The air which have to be breathe by reporter and others concern in write for the Press be dreadful and if Members do not believe it I wish they would go upstairs and see for themselves Something have be do I be aware in the shape of substitute the electric light for gas but I want to know why electricity be not to be carry through all part of the building I understand you intend to put it in the Members Lobby Why should it not go into other room where we now burn gas There seem to be a fallacy with regard to this matter of thermometer MACDONALD Queen County Courtney when I be interrupt in my remark upon this vote the other night I be endeavour to point out the distinction to me a very real one between the ventilation of the House itself and of the rest of the building With regard to the ventilation of the House itself I say I do not wish to speak at any length because I have not such scientific knowledge a would enable me to speak wisely upon the question but I do not wish to be understood that I be by any mean satisfy with the result achieve even in this Chamber The effect produce in our head very often be in itself sufficient to prove that we be suffer from bad ventilation I be inclined to think that the hot air pump into the House be not particularly conducive to health But what I have be mainly consider be the ventilation of the rest of the building and it seem to me that we labour under the great defect that the ventilation be not systematic that there be no attempt to ventilate accord to any definite rule or principle Occasionally a window may be open and a door swung back but speak generally the House be hermetically seal The temperature of the House be keep up to a certain height but I believe I be right in say it be the opinion of those best competent to form a that reasonable change of temperature be good for the human body We may be breathe the most pestilential atmosphere while the thermometer be what be suppose to be the proper temperature namely degrees I think we should be all healthy and good if we have an average mean temperature in the House of about degrees One source of the pestilential atmosphere be the employment of gas I wish we could have the electric light certainly in most part of the building although I do not mean to say that we should then get rid altogether of bad air The introduction of the electric light may be costly but then the constituency of the country be interested in the health of their Representatives they be interested in the legislator of the country have clear head good constitution and good temper when discharge the work of the country I think it be most important that the ventilation of the House should be confide to some instruct person If we be to have thoroughly good ventilation it must be scientific ventilation it must be conduct upon a rational principle by one man who quite understand the matter I beg to move the reduction of the Vote by FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS Dublin University I desire to say in the first place that I have never hear many of these point raise before tonight in the second place that the system of ventilation adopt not only in this Chamber but throughout these building generally be accord to the most approved principle of ventilation modern science have be able to suggest and in the third place that one officer a able and experienced and trustworthy an officer a we could have have charge of the whole establishment a regard ventilation The Gentleman have express a desire that the system of electric lighting should be carry further The House be aware that we have since the last Session be able to extend the system of electric light to a certain extent that be to say to the Members entrance and to some of the room connect with the reporter gallery We hope during the Easter Recess to extend it to the Lobby outside this House and to some other portion of the building but I do not think the Committee would approve of our enter upon a very large scheme of electric lighting in the present state of science on the subject COLONEL NOLAN Galway I do not quite agree with the view of my Friend a to the ventilation of the House itself My Friend find very little fault except in one particular he think there ought to be a varying temperature We have at the head of the Ventilating Department one of the most scientific men in England indeed he be on the question of ventilation the standard authority in England and at the present moment I understand that medical men recommend uniform temperature I think that consider the immense number of people accommodate in this building it be wonderful how well the place be ventilate Personally I should like to point out that the upper smoking room be continually overcrowd THE CHAIRMAN That be not relevant to this item COLONEL NOLAN Then I will simply say I trust we shall have an extension of the system of electric light It be no answer to u to say that the Office of Works be wait until the system be properly develop If the right Gentleman be go to wait until such time a that the electric light will be no use to the present Parliament What be the use of our provide for the next Parliament We have to provide for our comfort and health and I think the First Commissioner of Works should see that as soon a possible the arrangement for a development of electric lighting in the House be extend COOKE I can not help think the temperature of the House be keep too high I have notice that it be keep at or degree while in the Lobby the other night it be as high a degree Unfortunately I have have during the last week serious illness in my house and the doctor order that the temperature of the sick room should be keep at degree It occur to me that if degree be a proper temperature for a sick room it be scarcely a fit temperature for the House of Commons SIR FOSTER Derbyshire I must confess I be disappoint with the right Gentleman statement a to the introduction of the electric light Whatever be the condition of science the Members of the House of Commons ought to have the advantage of the best form of light yet invent When we remember that every gas burner even of the most improved kind consumes a much oxygen a five Members of the House The will see that we ought to have all the gas burner not only in the House itself but in the lobby and other pan of the building replace by a mean of light which would not interfere with the purity of the air The right Gentleman say this be the first time attention have be call to the bad atmosphere of the House I remember that in the last Parliament we be oblige to suspend a sit on account of the noxious atmosphere It be essential that in this Chamber we should have the pure air in order that we may bring to our work the best possible intellectual vigour One can not get that intellectual vigour and clearness of sight which we need unless we breathe the purest atmosphere The general temperature of the House be not conducive to vigorous intellectual effort It be probably five or six degree too high But when we leave the House and pas into the outer apartment especially the Division Lobbies and the Lobby just outside the atmosphere be still bad We do not have the building flush with fresh air a it ought to be Every part ought to be flush every night and morning and on Tuesdays between the morning and evening sitting I have notice that when Members make speech in this Chamber they always require some kind of beverage to sustain them in the effort That be mainly due to the fact that the atmosphere we breathe be unnaturally dry The right Gentleman say the ventilation of the House be conduct on the most approved scientific principle I know a little about ventilation It have be a study of mine for many year and I have never have much faith in scientific ventilation I believe an open window or an open door be after all the best form of ventilation When one go through the hospital ward a I do every other day often during the Session I find an open window the best system of ventilation I should like to see a similar mean of ventilation adopt here even at the risk of produce a draught I have observe that the complexion of Members become bleached by continuous attendance in the House and I believe that a cooler and moister air in the House it room and lobby would conduce to the efficiency of the work the personal comfort and the longevity of the Members of the House of the officer of the House and of those engage in report the Debates On that account I urge very strongly on the right Gentleman the introduction of electric light and a large flushing with pure air of the House and the adjoining apartment EGERTON Cheshire I thick that the system of ventilation be a nearly perfect a it can be What be wrong be the source of the air with which the House be supply That air be already vitiate instead of be fresh and pure Indeed it have already be breathe before we breathe it The subject be worthy of be report upon by a Committee and a Committee on which I serve which be know a the Stink Committee be anxious to make the necessary inquiry but be preclude from do so If the House can be supply with purer air that alone would do something to preserve the health and prolong the life of Members Northampton The point I wish to raise be comparatively speak a small one namely the lighting in the Dining Room which be open to Members and their friend The electric light there be so bad that on several occasion candle have have to be place on some of the side table I have already make this the subject of formal write complaint to the Kitchen Committee and trust that it may receive attention from the First Commissioner FITZGERALD Longford I wish to support my Friend in his protest against the scientific torture which be inflict upon Members of the House by mean of what I can prove to be vitiate atmosphere The symptom which a man experience when he obtain a seat in the House be most try but they be nothing after all to the symptom he experience when he have the honour to catch your eye First of all he sit here possibly for a couple of hour His pulse becomes weak the action of his heart become slow There be no doubt a you Sir have no doubt observe from time to time a difficulty in breathe Any keen observer will notice that Gentlemen who sit on these Benches be breathe more or less from their abdominal region There be a curious sensation of hunger and one can not eat when food be present to him The whole system culminate in the state of coma which we often see exhibit by Gentlemen who sit on the Benches below the Gangway These be the undoubted symptom of poisoning by carbonic acid gas and the air which produce these symptom must be very heavily charge with the gas Well Sir there be many way of ventilate the chamber You may do it in a natural and you may do it in an unnatural way but I think of all the piece of scientific blundering that be ever perpetrate upon an intelligent body of men it be that which have be adopt in ventilate this Chamber I be told and I believe it can not very well be contradict that the air which we breathe here be obtain from the cellar Now Sir I be sure you will agree with me that there be nothing in the world which keep well in a cellar but wine This air pass into the House be charge with carbonic acid gas which pass through the floor in an unnatural way and in so do it obtain a double charge of the gas which be in turn throw out through the skin of Members Surely you do not want to be scientist to know that this carbonic acid gas must go somewhere It be bad enough that it should be inflict upon u but you must remember it pass through the grating into the lady gallery and therefore you be not only poison yourselves but you be poison those poor lady who be good enough to come down here Now you will say it be of no use complain about the ventilation unless you can suggest a remedy I propose presently to suggest a remedy and hope that it will be put into operation No man in his sens except one suffering from acute bronchitis would live in an atmosphere of over degree and here therefore we have proof in the first place that scientist be humbug and in the second place that we be be scientifically poison What be the result of living in an atmosphere of degree and in a vitiated atmosphere like this It be the symptom of which I have speak and the effect be twofold They be present and they be remote I have refer to the present to the remote I propose now to call attention After you have sit in this House for six eight or ten month your head become as bare a a billiard ball and I think it may be observe that of the Members of this House can not read without glass and be in fact half blind Now this be a clear case of poisoning by carbonic acid gas Thousands of pound have be spend on the ventilation of this Chamber but I be go to perform a service to this country and to Parliament by suggest a remedy gratuitously and I think that remedy can be apply at a cost of from to Let those scientific gentleman for whom I have great respect accept my remedy if they will In the first place you must get out of the foggy atmosphere of science and you must walk into the clear air of common sense Let your carpenter get to work during the Recess and stop up those hole in the floor which let up the air open your window which constitute the proper outlet for the carbonic acid gas and then without have recourse to science Members will be able to sit here in comfort and listen to the speech of their colleague while I be perfectly certain that the lady who come down will be very much benefit by the change of atmosphere SIR GEORGE CAMPBELL I must express the extreme surprise I felt when I hear the right Gentleman say he have never hear of these complaint before Why Sir we hear complaint night after night on this matter It be an acknowledged fact that for many year the House contain the bad possible air the scientific gentleman in charge of the ventilation have be pump up the air from the drain and I be bound to say that since the Committee cause that drain to be stop up a very great improvement have be effect I heartily endorse the proposition of my Friend that the Committee should be allow to go a little further and to look to the upper as well a to the under ventilation of the House I remember it be remark in one debate that we want a little of God air instead of Percy air Why should we have this artificial air from Percy instead of be allow to have God air While I be speak I should like to ask how it be that while the electric light have be extend in this House there have be a simultaneous increase in the charge for gas The gas company be even bad tyrant than the water company for they get a good price for an article which be invariably bad and I therefore think we be entitle to know why while there be a large increase in the charge for electric light there be an addition of to the charge for gas Cornwall I wish to ask a question in regard to the electric light I see it have be introduce into the entrance Lobby and I wish to know why it should not be extend to the Cloak Room This point be bring up last year and it be then point out that the architectural beauty of that room be be spoil owe to blacken by the gas I do not think the extension of the electric light would be very expensive and it would undoubtedly preserve a portion of the House in which we all take great interest and which be one of the fine part of it architecturally speak I would also ask the right Gentleman if he will not reconsider his decision which he have just announce in regard to the further extension of the light He suggest that we have well wait until we can get a perfected system but Sir you will have to wait until Doomsday if you wait for that and I think it would be absurd to postpone the general use of the light until then Why the railway would never have arrive at their present pitch of perfection in locomotion if originally it have be decide to wait for a perfected system And then Sir I come to the question of oil lamp This matter have be raise on several occasion in connection with this Vote and I must say it be an extraordinary thing that whilst we be pay so much money for the electric light and for gas we should also be pay for oil lamp These lamp in use be supply to the Committee Rooms to the Lobbies and to the Reporters Rooms and so on They be very dangerous and inconvenient and I think it would be a great advantage if gas or the electric light could be substitute for them As far a the general question of the ventilation of the Chamber be concern I have notice that when the Chamber be not occupy the window be keep closed Now I hope that order will be give that they shall be throw open when the House be empty in order that fresh air may be introduce I do not desire to cast any reflection on the character or ability of those who be entrust with the ventilation of the Chamber but I think we have the full right when the Vote come up to discuss these matter and I hope that some of the suggestion which have be throw out in the course of the debate will be carefully consider Donegal I consider that the discussion have be a very useful one The Member for in refer to the atmosphere of this House spoke of it a have a tendency to make people prematurely old Well I have be a Member of the House nearly four year When I enter it my hair be perfectly black now it be almost white But that be not all Last year have be in constant attendance from the beginning of the Session till the middle of July I leave England invalid and for four week I be confine to my bed while my convalescence occupy another four week and I thoroughly believe Courtney that this be due to breathe the poisonous atmosphere of the House I be only glad that by the mercy of Providence I have be sufficiently restore to resume my labours Northampton I rise Sir to reassure the constituent of the Gentleman who have speak l they should imagine there be a probability we shall all perish and die I for my part consider the ventilation of this House to be absolutely perfect Statistics Courtney be in my favour for they show there be nothing which conduce so much to longevity a be a Member of this House and sit in it during long hour We have be tell that the air come up from the cellar charge with carbonic acid gas But Sir the air do not come up from the cellar it enter at the at the end of this Chamber and instead of pass through the Ladies Gallery it go through the suspender above We have be tell that the window ought to be open Why Sir that would make a draught downwards and disorganize the whole system it would destroy the perfect ventilation which we now enjoy There be however one little point I wish to call attention to Rain be now pour through into the Opposition Lobby I do not know whether that be a deeply laid scheme on the part of the Government to swamp the Opposition In conclusion I wish to say that Percy be a gentleman who thoroughly understand the system of ventilation and it be hard that we should denounce him when his system be a near perfection a possible I should have speak before in order to disabuse the mind of Members of the feeling of terror probably produce by some of the speech have it not be for a hope that terror might cause an immediate exodus of Members and that the discussion should in that way be bring to an end But Sir I can confirm the statement of the Member for Northampton that the air we breathe be the purest that can be bring from outside the House and it be carry away not through the Ladies Gallery but through the roof I have be ask a to the electric light in the Dining Room We have try the experiment of disperse the light in the different corner of one room and a a result the light will be similarly disperse throughout the other Dining Rooms with as little delay a possible The reason why the electric light system have not be carry out more completely in this House be that hitherto we have not be quite clear whether it would be cheap to manufacture the electric light for ourselves than to take it from one of the electric lighting company We be still watch the development of that question but in the meantime we be extend the light as much a with our present plant we can As to this year Estimate for gas show an increase over that provide for in last year Estimate it be account for first in calculate the amount that may be require we must remember the gas burn during the Autumn Session and secondly by the fact that more room be now light with gas and that in the Reporters and other Rooms several gas fire have be introduce Further than that there be a general demand for more brilliant light for instance within the last few year the amount of gas burn in the Lobby outside this Chamber have increase per cent MACDONALD I think that we the Party of reform who be not confine to one side of the House have some reason to complain of the spirit in which we have be meet by the First Commissioner of Works He have altogether deny the reality of our complaint and I suppose doubt their reality still in spite of the medical testimony that have be bring forward Now the Member for Northampton have not reply to my argument my speech refer not to the ventilation of this House but to the air in the remainder of the building If the right Gentleman have meet u in a spirit of concession and promise that some attention should be pay to this matter I should not have persist in my opposition but I regret that it will now be necessary to divide the Committee Cornwall Mid My attention have be call to the item of for oil lamp That strike me a rather heavy for if you have five hundred lamp in use and you burn say a of oil per week in each which I think be an outside estimate you would in thirty week spend only I think there must be some serious waste in this item I hope the right Gentleman will look into this matter This question have be raise several time I may point out that the charge be not only for oil but also for the hire of the lamp and I can not hold out any immediate hope of reduce the item I ask Members a men of business if there be any sense in an Assembly like this hire it oil lamp I should like to know what we pay for the hire I fancy if any one of u want lamp in our house we should be look on a fit for Bedlam if we start by hire the lamp I would like to ask the right Gentleman whether he would amplify his statement by tell u where he hire the lamp and what he pay for them I will ascertain I should like the right Gentleman to tell u whether the lamp be hire on the three year system POWER Waterford Practically my Friend Amendment amount to a Vote of Censure on the First Commissioner of Works but my Friend have make some mistake The present system of ventilation be invent some year ago and three or four Committees have sit on the question It be universally admit that no one more competent to manage this system could be find than Percy The variation in temperature be settle by the Speaker or the Chairman a the case may be and the censure if any should be direct against them I would appeal to the right Gentleman that the Committee of last year should be and then perhaps my Friend would withdraw his Amendment FITZGERALD Longford I do not wish to reflect in any way upon Percy but I say that Percy be deceive by the atmosphere of scientific knowledge in which he be move I decline to believe that the carbonic acid gas that be generate in this Chamber can be convey through the ten little pipe in the ceiling It be a fallacy We be be poison there be no doubt about it and until we have the House ventilate upon some scientific principle we shall continue to be poison MACDONALD If the right Gentleman will the Committee I will not press the matter to a division I may say that I do not wish to make a personal attack upon anybody but merely to assert the great principle of healthy sanitation MUNRO FERGUSON Last year the question be raise a to place Reports of the proceeding of this House in the different lobby and room where Members spend the interval of their time and in order to take the sense of the Committee on the question I beg to move the reduction of the Vote by It be a great inconvenience when Members be in the Lobby or other part of the House not to know what be go on here The number of the House be so inordinately large that it be impossible for u all to find place here even if we would A great many speech be make to which very few people desire to listen and it would effect a very great economy of time if Members could arrange to come in at the time when they felt their presence be require A good many speech would I think be spar if Members be not force to loiter about the House in order to discover the exact minute at which their presence here be need The fact of who presides of who be address the House and the course of the debate ought I think to be post either through the tape machine or in some other way in the Lobbies Smoking Rooms The only objection I have hear urge against the proposal have come from the Whips I do not think everything can be sacrifice to the Whips and I beg to move the reduction I think there be a great deal to be say in favour of the proposal of the Member and I have more than once express that opinion in this House I prepare at one time a scheme for the purpose of give effect to such a proposal but decide opposition be threaten from many different quarter and it be abandon If there be a sufficient apparent unanimity or even the opinion of a considerable majority in favour of the change I would certainly do my best to have it carry out It be not necessary to reduce the Vote by Let the Gentleman satisfy me that there be a considerable majority of the House in favour of the proposal and I will endeavour to deal with it Stockport I must say I do not see why we should depart from our Constitutional mode of express our opinion in this House It be not competent for an Member to move an increase of the Vote or I be sure we would gladly do so on this matter That be so the only thing we can do be to vote for a reduction No doubt this House be bad supply with news of what be do inside it than any place in London If you go home to dine and want to know what be go on in the House you be oblige to go to your Club If like good boy you come straight to the House in obedience to your Whip all you can do be to hang about in the hope of find out what have happen I hope that telegraphic information will be give to u and that my right Friend will not press upon u the idea that if we want anything we be to get up round robins to the Government Perhaps my right Friend will be able to induce the telegraph company to give u the information gratis if he be hard press We supply them with information and it be not too much to ask that they should give u report of our proceeding BUXTON Tower Hamlets Poplar Whilst I should be glad to obtain an addition to our present mean of know what have happen in the House I be totally oppose to the suggestion of my Friend Munro Ferguson that we should have information telegraph over the building a to what be go on at the moment I do not think that the present attendance of Members in the House be too great except on big occasion and I believe the adoption of my Friend proposal would tend to diminish that attendance rather than to increase it Of course we should all rush in if we know that my Friend be go to speak but as far a humble individual like myself be concerned our only chance of get an audience be to wait in the House until chance favour u I trust that the Amendment will be press to a division and that it will be reject York I believe that Sir Buxton when a Member of this House get up a memorial in favour of a proposal of this kind and that it be sign by a very large number of Members on both side A distinct declaration be then make from the Government Bench in favour of give Members some facility of the kind For my own part I strongly support the proposal that such facility should be give HARDY Kent Medway If we be to consider the convenience of Members who will not take the trouble to be in the House we have well have telephone to all the room so that Members could hear the debate without enter the House at all It seem to me it be an absurdity to suppose that Members who do not sit in the House can be keep continually post up in what be go on GARDNER Essex Saffron Walden I heartily support the proposal of my Friend the Member for Munro Ferguson but if the right Gentleman will give u any assurance that this very useful reform can be carry out I hope my Friend will not proceed to a division Mid I wish to ask the right Gentleman the First Commissioner of Works whether it be not possible to remove the grating from the Ladies Gallery The stranger who find seat above the clock be allow to watch the proceeding of the House without have a screen interpose between them and u and I do not see why the lady at the other end of the room should not be permit to do the same Only lady be allow to come here at once and only those in the front row can see what be go on It seem to me to be a ridiculous thing to keep the grating where it be CAVENDISH Whitehaven I wish to ask the right Gentleman the First Commissioner whether any step have be take to place the control of the whole of this building under one Minister A portion of the Houses of Parliament be at present under the control of the hereditary Great Chamberlain and it be by the leave of the hereditary Great Chamberlain that a statue be erect in the Central Hall which greatly interfere with and disfigure it beauty The Great Chamberlain be an official over whom Parliament have no control whatever and I wish to know whether any step have be take to place the building under the control of one official The subject of the Ladies Gallery have be very frequently raise in this House and I do not think the House be in favour of any alteration in the direction suggest by the Gentleman opposite In answer to my right Friend Cavendish I have to say that no step have be take to interfere with the jurisdiction of the Lord Chamberlain As the right Gentleman seem to have no reason for refuse to remove the grating except that the House have never pronounce in favour of it removal I think the best thing be to give the House an opportunity of pronounce an opinion on the subject and I therefore move to reduce the Vote by Northampton I do not know whether my Friend have propose this reduction in the interest of Members or of the lady My own opinion be that the lady would prefer to have the grating I do not think we be so particularly ornamental that they desire further facility to look at u and whilst they have the grating in front of them they can be more at their ease and need not unless they wish come in even dress I should like to know whether my Friend have poll the lady on the subject I do not think they desire the removal of the grating and I shall therefore vote against the Amendment FOWLER London I recollect that twenty year ago on the Motion of Samuelson brother of the Member for the Forest of Dean Samuelson we have a great debate on this subject and decide against remove the grill I do not see why the House should differ now from the decision then arrive at HERBERT GARDNER Essex Saffron Walden I have give notice of an Amendment by the reduction of the Vote which I hope I may not be oblige to move attention be giver to my request Members who have occasion to visit the Tea Room during the afternoon know how inconveniently crowd it frequently be so that Members can not find a place at the table and be detain an unreasonable time from the House Eight table with four chair each give but place for the whole of the Members of the House and the addition of chair and table will not meet the requirement I would suggest that the room in which the paper be now lay out should be add to the Tea Room and that the paper should be place in the Library It would be a simple change to make and a much large number of u would then be able to take tea at the same time The Baronet the Member for Sir Lawson and friend of the Temperance movement should support me in this because if Members fail to find accommodation in the Tea Room they be drive to other place where drink be supply of not so harmless a character I beg to move the reduction of the Vote by Northampton I can hardly agree with my Friend It be in I think that mainly through the alliance between the noble Lord the Member for Paddington Lord Randolph Churchill and myself it be agree we should have a Smoking Room on the same floor with this House It be agree we should have the Tea Room a a Smoking Room and a very fair Smoking Room it would be But a much respect Member of this House Beresford Hope oppose the proposal and get up a round robin against it The present Smoking Room would then have become the Tea Room But then we be still in the same Smoking Room from to together at one time in a room much too small and often when we retire from the excitement of debate here for the soothing influence of nicotine we can not find a vacant seat Of late much accommodation be require by Gentlemen engage in chess I do not object to chess but let u have a Smoking Room and a Chess Room in some proportion to the number of Members use it and we can give up the present Smoking Room to the tea drinker We should have have it in but for the deference pay to the wish of the late Beresford Hope and I hope now that the First Commissioner of Works whom I sometimes see look through the heavy atmosphere of the Smoking Room with an expression of pity and despair on his face will give u some hope that a good arrangement will be make It be only within the last few day that I explain to the Committee in relation to another Vote that a one result of the opening of new room on the other side of Westminster Hall I should be able to provide an additional smoking room for Members of this House and I do submit that consider how long this Vote have be under discussion the question of whether the tea should be take to the Smoking Room or the smoke to the Tea Room should not further detain the Committee Tower Hamlets The Tower of London come within the limit of my constituency and I propose to move a reduction of this Vote by way of give expression to opinion on a matter that concern the inhabitant of I have to ask why the public be exclude from the riverside promenade access to which they enjoy in former time Two year ago I present to the Secretary for War a petition sign by of my constituent pray that the public might have free access to the Tower Gardens also to the riverside promenade I thankfully acknowledge that the first request be grant and in consequence thousand of the inhabitant of the East End principally of the working class have enjoy these garden lay out by the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association at a cost of and maintain at an annual expenditure of The expense of maintenance would be considerably reduce if the Tower authority would direct the attendance in the Gardens of a couple of to act a caretaker The duty would not be onerous and the uniform of the Yeomen of the Guard would be an additional attraction The concession make by the Secretary for War be make in an economical spirit he stipulate that the lay out of the garden should not be a source of public expense therefore the money have to be obtain from outside source It be perhaps a similar economical spirit that prevent a military band play there in the summer Last year a police band play there every Saturday and this year it have be arrange that they shall play every alternate Saturday I apply to the Constable of the Tower to fill up the gap by allow the military band to play on the other Saturdays but he reply that the band be occupy at the West End of the town I do not doubt that the band be more pleasantly and profitably employ but they would be more usefully employ in give enjoyment to the people of the East End whose opportunity of musical enjoyment be more rare Then the use of the riverside promenade be refuse The reason assign be that war store be land there This be a very old story The Gentleman will forgive me for interrupt him but the question can not be appropriately raise on this Vote it come under the War Office Vote I apprehend that access to the Tower Gardens might well be discuss under this Vote THE CHAIRMAN It be a question of fact what portion of the expenditure upon the Tower come under Item B If the First Commissioner say the ground be not refer to under the item then it would not be proper to discuss the question I have ascertain the fact or I should not have interrupt the Member MUNRO FERGUSON I take the opportunity of call the attention of the First Commissioner to the want of facility for see the public record in the Record Office It be propose to bring in the electric light and I think the public might derive some advantage from a good exhibition of these record At Paris in the there be the most interesting collection in Europe perhaps and so arrange that the history of France for century can be read in the actual document in glass case along the wall In the Record Office document be stow away and quite inaccessible owe to the unfitness of the building for exhibition In France the collection be open on certain day to the public other day be reserve for scientific men and I trust it may be possible to allow our Record Office to do some educational work that the public may derive some advantage from the collection MUNRO FERGUSON I should like to ask whether there be any prospect of the new survey of Scotland proceed at a more rapid pace than have mark it progress of late Yes I answer a question on this subject the other day and be able to assure the Member who ask me that as soon a the survey of Lancashire and Yorkshire be complete which will be within the next two year then three or four division of the Survey Staff will be at once apply to a of those six county of Scotland in which the Member be I think principally interested With a view to facilitate the work a Survey Office will be open at Edinburgh KENNY Tyrone Mid May I ask if any progress have be make with the Survey in Ireland or what the Government propose on that subject Further I would ask whether any new map have be produce for the use of the Land Court in Ireland Also I would suggest that new map should be produce at a price that would bring them within the reach of suitor in the Court At present an exorbitant price be charge a prohibitory price so far a suitor be concerned Yes the Survey be proceed satisfactorily in Ireland The Member probably know the revision of the Survey on the scale have be proceed for some time but by order of the Treasury in the revision will in future be make and be now be make on the scale KENNY Will it be make uniform I believe it will eventually Are we definitely to understand that Lancashire and Yorkshire be the only two English county of which the Surrey be not complete and that when these two county be complete proceeding will be take immediately for survey the six remain county of Scotland That be so Armagh I would press the question of my Friend a to the expensiveness of the Government map which prevent their use be avail of in the Courts Seeing that Parliament vote money for the Survey I can not for the life of me see why such a high rate should be charge for copy of these map The cost of the small map be I believe and that be the amount perhaps of several year reduction of rent on a hold I would impress upon the Department the issue of cheap map for the use of suitor The state of the case be that map be produce for the Land Court at considerable expense and be often use by the suitor It be suppose that the expense be recoverable from the party to the different suit in the Land Court but it have unfortunately be find very difficult to make this sum really available Again and again the outstanding balance have be so large that attention have be call to them by the Public Accounts Committee In the outstanding balance be odd and on December they have rise to odd I be afraid it be not possible to promise anything far on the subject Why should not the Government prepare cheap map Poor tenant who appear before the Land Commission Court endeavour to obtain a reduction of rent have to show their holding on transfer on parchment from the Ordnance map and these often cost more than several year of the reduction ultimately grant The small of these map I believe cost which be a very serious item for these poor people to have to pay STEVENSON Suffolk Eye Will not the right Gentleman consider the desirability of make these map more acceptable and available to a large class of person than be at present the case In those country where there be a compulsory system of land registration map be keep in the Post Offices and other public place and the public can consult them in some case for a small fee and in other case for no fee at all This system do not prevail in England but I can not help think that if it do it would be of great convenience to people who desire to consult map of their own locality from time to time I hope the right Gentleman will take into his favourable consideration the advisability of adopt some such scheme a this KENNY The question I raise be not a to litigant in the Landed Estates Court but those before County Courts and Judges of Assize At the present moment it be impossible to obtain an Ordnance Survey map in Ireland on the small question of title for less than I say that that be an absurd charge and amount very often to absolute injustice be do to a poor litigant The case in in the Landed Estates Court be due to the action of the Land Registry itself who require these map to be put in a evidence Northampton I do not gather from the statement in the Estimates that much be realize from the sale of these map The right Gentleman say the cheap cost be for a portion of a district or a county It be an old system on the part of the Government to have large profit and small sale but what we would desire to see would be large sale and small profit The paper on which these map be print do not cost but a certain amount of the cost of get up the Survey be charge on each map sell and the result be that poor people can not buy them The Surveys cost much more than be realize by the map and I think we ought to stretch a point and let the cost of survey be a little more so long a the result will be to cheapen the price of the map The cost of prepare the map be only that of paper and printing Nothing be charge for the Survey of which these map be the result I do not think it would be reasonable for anyone to expect to get the map for less than be at present charge Are we to believe that these map cost JACKSON No That which cost be I believe a drawing of a particular holding I be speak of the ordinary Survey available to all the country for all purpose The map be produce as cheaply a possible STEVENSON Will the right Gentleman consider the advisability of send the map down to the locality He might send them to the most populous locality first and afterwards to the less populous part of the country I will consider the matter TANNER Cork Mid I always refrain from give unnecessary trouble to the right Gentleman the First Commissioner of Works who be invariably most courteous in his answer but I must ask for some explanation a regard one of these I desire to know how it be that there be a large decrease in the pay of labourer connect with the Ordnance Survey and I must say I do not know why it should be leave to an Irish Member to ask the question I find there be a decrease of in the pay of the poor labourer who do the work and I wish to know how it come about I think we be entitle to inquire into these small item especially a in one direction we notice an increase and a the answer we get be frequently of a very unsatisfactory character The Survey to which the Item A refers be approach it completion therefore it be not necessary to employ as much labour in connection with it now a have be essential in the past The increase the Member have refer to be owe to the fact that we do not take quite enough money last year and we be anxious this year to avoid that unfortunate state of thing TANNER I be afraid I can not remain satisfied with that answer although the right Gentleman have give it with his usual courtesy I do not like take up the time of the Committee on such a small matter but this discussion will I think show that it be impossible to get a satisfactory explanation from the people who be spend the money of the taxpayer Perhaps the right Gentleman will explain how it be that under Item A which have reference to the staff which I believe include the official who do the least work and get the best pay there be only a reduction of whilst there be such a great reduction under Item C which cover the labourer I hope that on ground of the right Gentleman will give u some explanation of this Cornwall I should like to ask the right Gentleman whether since we have this Vote under consideration last year he have give any attention to the question of the possibility of make good arrangement for the sale of the Ordnance Survey map Dissatisfaction have be express on more than one occasion with the monopoly certain house posse in the sale of these map and it have be point out that it would tend very much to the convenience of the public generally if the agency for the sale of the Ordnance map be extend I would ask also if the right Gentleman have have an opportunity of consider since we discuss that Vote last year the suggestion I make that special attention should be extend to the mining district of the country in regard to this matter of Survey THE CHAIRMAN The Member be remind last year that the Geological Survey be not under this Vote I be lead into the error by see the word Engraving the Geological Survey in the Estimate However I will bring the on under a Vote for the Science and Art Department The reduction under C be not so much for labour a Civil Assistants It be necessary to employ a staff to supervise the revision of the Survey a it be go on and the course we be now adopt be the result of experiment we have make We believe that the system we have adopt be the best for the convenience of the public I think look at the usefulness of the Ordnance Survey sheet in the Land Courts that some mean should be adopt to prevent the public be unnecessarily tax on their acquisition of them I beg to move that you Sir do report Progress and ask leave to sit again DYKE Yorkshire Rotherham I should like to take this opportunity of ask the right Gentleman the First Commissioner of Works one or two question concern the Normal School South Kensington I desire to know what the condition of that School be at the present time because if we mean to have a Technical Education Bill if we mean to turn to account the great Polytechnics which be be establish in London with the assistance of the Charity Commissioners we must provide capable teacher for the technical school The great centre for the training of technical school teacher be the Normal School the condition of which I can not help thinking be grievously unsatisfactory Now Sir it be mainly a question of building You have get some of the best scientific teacher professor whose name be well know in the world of science you give them good apparatus all that I fully admit but your building be so choked that it be utterly impossible for the school to compare with any other great school even with those at Manchester at Leeds or that support by the Admiralty at Greenwich If you go into the Chemical Department you will find such a crowd of student and such an insanitary condition of thing that if it prevail in any ordinary elementary school Her Majesty Inspector would at once reduce the number of pass on the ground that there be not a sufficient number of cubic foot of air for each student or child I suppose the right Gentleman be willing to admit that the industrial and commercial welfare of this country be considerably bind up with the important question of technical education But Sir I would willingly see the Science and Art grant reduce if the amount of the reduction could be devote to the improvement of our Normal School I will make this suggestion even I think there be a sum of a year spend on a short summer course of lecture last three or four week I doubt whether that money be productive of very much benefit and I think it might be lay out to great advantage if the building be improve say at the outlay of the capital sum represent by an annual income of When professor from other country visit our Normal School at South Kensington they be amaze that England in it great central school of teach provide such an inadequate building In in the Queen Speech it be say that we be to have the high type of instruction and the most perfect training I believe it be intend that that should be so but the building be now not nearly large enough for all the subject which be teach in it Originally I think it be intend to be devote to one subject but now we have teach in it physics chemistry mineralogy and astronomy and in fact all scientific subject A little laboratory have be build on the other side in which the Professor of Physics can teach the elementary student and in regard to that I may say that it be at one and the same time the cheap most simple and ugly of structure It might have be wise perhaps to have spend money on a more permanent structure and at any rate it must be admit that the school can not long be carry on in it present building We have there the very best material for teacher a professor inform me that there be a good class of student than could be find either at Owen College Manchester or at the Victoria College at Leeds Then you ought to give them good opportunity for pursue their study At present it be impossible to carry out some of the high physical experiment and you do not encourage these student to follow up the more advanced research in their fourth year simply because there be no room for the purpose I venture to say this be a penny wise and pound foolish policy If we be go to provide technical instruction throughout the country a we have be tell twice in the Queen Speech it be intend to do we must not neglect the provision of teacher and of give professor who be eminently capable men every opportunity of do justice to the young people who go to them for instruction I know well enough that the Secretary to the Treasury will give u very little hope I suppose he think the chief object and aim of man be to ask for nothing from the Treasury but I have some hope that the right Gentleman the First Commissioner of Works will afford u some assistance that he will bring to bear his upon educational matter and will help u to make this Normal School even more successful than it have be in the past I think there be some reasonable ground for ask for an improvement in the building in which the school be carry on because it will relieve the professor who can not now do their duty towards the student and towards the country HENRY ROSCOE Manchester I wish to be allow to add my confirmation to the remark of the Member who have just speak He have not say a word too much a regard the condition of the Normal School and a regard the accommodation in that school compare to that which I know exists in school of a similar character on the Continent It be really a disgrace that we in England should have to put up with this condition of the Normal School I know every corner of the place I know in every department the student be crowd and indeed the Professor of Chemistry tell me he be almost ashamed to take high fee from the student when he could only afford them such poor facility a regard accommodation a exist in the school I trust the right Gentleman will take this matter into his grave consideration Before long I hope we shall have a Technical Education Bill bring before the House but of what use will it be unless we can obtain competent teacher We can not get such teacher unless we have proper facility for train them It must be remember that in other country in almost every centre of population Normal Science Schools exist yet this be the only Government school of the kind in this country It be build for one purpose and it have be convert for us for which it be not in the least fitted and I do feel that the honour of the country be at stake and that we ought to put up with this state of thing no longer There be plenty of space for a proper building on the west side of Exhibition Road As the right Gentleman well know a portion of the land have already be offer to the Government the site be an admirable one and a really efficient School of Science might at no very great expense be erect A large number of inquiry have be make into this subject by Committees of this House and all have agree that something should be do May we not hope Sir that the Government will really attend to this matter and say whether or not they can not put the Normal School in a satisfactory position I do not think I can altogether support the view of my Friend the Member for Rotherham with regard to the summer class I believe they be of very great value inasmuch a they be available for teacher who can not come up at any other time and who devote their holiday to attend this course of lecture I do not think it would be a wise thing in any shape or way to reduce this most important work of the Normal School but I believe if money be expend in erect a suitable building it would be well lay out and would produce the best possible return I trust the right Gentleman will pay attention to this subject and will impress upon the Government the great value which scientific men throughout the country attach to this matter BARTLEY Islington I should like Sir to support the remark of the Members who have just speak I think it be a very discreditable thing that the building in South Kensington be not be complete with great rapidity When we consider that the Estimates for this year contain but a sum of for work alteration and addition it do seem to me a most unsatisfactory state of affair that year after year these building should be leave in the state in which they be Now Sir it be part of a very much large question than the mere Normal School and in regard to that School I must say I be very glad to have see what a success it have prove I think it be time a be matter be take in hand and that the School be place in a proper building think if it be take up by the present Government it would be a step in the right direction There be many mean by which the necessary money could be obtain I can not agree with the Gentleman who suggest that the summer course of lecture should be discontinue in order to supply the fund I agree with Sir Henry Roscoe that they be a most important branch of the work which be be perform but if we can not have an additional grant I would suggest that we might for a time stop the purchase of specimen and provide money in that way There be one question refer to by the Gentleman who have just speak and that be the subject of fee in the Normal School I venture to say that those fee be rather too high and the subject ought to be very carefully look into for you must consider that we be suppose to be train men who shall teach in our various school and fix the fee so high really preclude many from attend at all Finally I would urge most emphatically on the Government that they should boldly grapple with the whole subject and not be afraid of spend a sum of say which might be necessary to complete the magnificent building which we have at South Kensington MUNRO FERGUSON Without go into the technical detail of the question I should like to support my Friend the Member for Rotherham in the description which he have give of these building at South Kensington It must be quite evident that the accommodation there be wholly insufficient for the number of student and have regard to the increase demand for scientific education likely to be make upon the teaching staff in the future I think there should be no hindrance in the way of provide a much accommodation a possible I do not agree at all with my Friend however in his suggestion that any reduction should be make in the expenditure I believe we ought to make up our mind to spend a good deal more upon institution of this character I do not see why in this country we should not have establishment equal to those at Berlin and Zurich and I sincerely trust that this school will be take in hand and finish upon some regular plan and that we shall have an institution worthy the capital of this country FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS Dublin University I do not think this be the occasion to raise any debate on the general policy of the Education Department in reference to the South Kensington Institutions I remember that last year the debate on this Vote have special reference to the physical laboratory and a a result the Government take energetic action and even present a Supplementary Estimate on their own responsibility It be admit that the result of their effort have be satisfactory to those who be interested in that matter yet now it be attempt to make out a strong case against the Government for inactivity I do not intend to say that nothing have be do My complaint be that the physical arrangement have completely break down My humble duty be to provide what be order by the Government and the Member have no right to lay against me his complaint upon the general policy with regard to the increase of accommodation He have ask if I myself have inspect the building Of course I have I have visit them several time and I may mention also that the First Lord of the Treasury the Chancellor of the Exchequer the Vice President of the Council and others make since these question be discuss last year a most careful visit to every part of the building One of the conclusion arrive at be that before additional building be erect it would be a good thing to get rid of a good deal of the material fill up the Galleries exist at the present time Directly that suggestion be make we be of course meet with protest from the authority at South Kensington but eventually a Committee be appoint to examine and report on what may be do in this direction Before the building can be enlarge we ought to await the Report of that Committee I can only add that as soon a the Education Department can persuade the Treasury that fresh building be necessary I shall be only too glad to give every facility in my power But it must be bear in mind that the noble Lord the Member for South Paddington be already protest against the large sum which have be expend at South Kensington and the Government have to stand between financial reform on the one side and enthusiastic advocate for the development of South Kensington on the other They be therefore bound to go carefully to work They will however give careful and respectful consideration to any suggestion which may emanate from Members on both side SHAW Bradford Central I think the Government have adopt a wise course in appoint a Committee to investigate the condition of the Galleries on the western side of Exhibition Road for I have always be of opinion that they be crowd with many object of no very great utility I should however be glad to hear of whom the Committee be compose With regard to the building on the other side of Exhibition Road most people would be very glad to see them complete in a style worthy of the nation because they contain collection of the great value and beauty and it be discreditable to the country that they should be leave in the condition in which they be But some general plan should be decide on before the Government be ask to spend a large sum of money upon them BARTLEY Islington Are the Committee to have power to weed out both the Science and Art collection Of whom be the Committee compose Lord Lord Rayleigh Sir Bernhard Samuelson Sir Douglas Crawford and Sir Henry Roscoe CAVENDISH Whitehaven The right Gentleman have not inform u if the Committee will have control over the artistic collection SIR HENRY ROSCOE Perhaps I may say the Committee be appoint to deal with the Science collection alone not with the Art collection CONWAY Leitrim It be satisfactory to know that the Government be take step to investigate the state of affair at South Kensington and that Members on both side of the House be take lively interest in the technical education of the country But that be not all that be want We know that all work and no play be just a bad for the student a all play and no work and I think we be bind to see that they be provide with suitable amusement Now there be some good lawn tennis ground The be reserve for the permanent official of the Department I think it would be well if the Government through the First Commissioner of Works would at interval give an opportunity to the student in South Kensington to avail themselves of these area Birmingham There be no doubt that the building on the east side of Exhibition Road be insufficient for the work do by the Department The building from which be send out all the object lent to the local museum be a most miserable place indeed it be hardly weather proof No merchant deal in the most common object would have such a miserable place from which to dispatch his good Again at one time there be a Gallery specially assign to the Exhibition of Works execute by Art student in what be call the National Competition The object of the Exhibition be of course educational Teachers in the Art Schools all over the country visit the Exhibition for the purpose of ascertain the position other school take in the National Competition and to learn what the shortcoming of their own school be the Exhibition instead of be in one room so that the work of the various school can be easily compare be scatter about the ordinary museum It be very difficult indeed for any visitor to form a general idea of what be send up from the country This be one of the point it be very desirable the Department should attend to I very much regret there be no Representative of Art on the Committee which have be appoint because Art be quite as important a Science CONWAY I beg to ask for an answer a to the use of the lawn tennis court by the student I will consult the Vice President of the Council on the matter which do not come within my Department POWELL Wigan I sincerely hope the Government will not much longer delay the commencement of the work necessary to finish the building on the east side of the road The incomplete state of those building be no credit to the Administration of the country TANNER Cork Mid I think my Friend Conway be entitle to an answer upon the point he have raise I know the Vice President of the Council be in the Lobby half a minute ago Surely he can be consult at once It be not a matter over which I have any control whatever but I will make a representation on the subject to my right Friend the Vice President KENNY Tyrone Mid I see the Vice President sit behind the Treasury Bench If he would come forward and explain the matter he would no doubt considerably facilitate business VICE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL Sir HART DYKE Kent Dartford I be serve upon a Committee upstairs and leave the Committee Room to answer three or four question in the House Having do that I return to the Committee and now I have have to leave again I really have not the faint idea of what have take place in the House CONWAY repeat his observation whereupon HART DYKE say I will make a thorough inquiry Perhaps the most practical way of raise the question will be upon the South Kensington Vote Between now and then I will make inquiry and be prepare to make a statement to the House on the point Vote agree to Motion make and Question propose That a sum not exceed be grant to Her Majesty to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year end on the day of March for the Maintenance and Repair of the British Museum and Natural History Museum Buildings for Rents of Premises Supply of Water Fuel and other Charges attendant thereon The Leader of the House just now appeal to Members to facilitate the progress of business by pass the Estimates a speedily a possible Under ordinary circumstance I should be quite willing to accede to the request of the right man but I think the nation ought to be congratulate on the manner in which the Estimates be now be discuss and on the very different state of thing obtain now to that which formerly obtain when million of money be vote by a handful of Members without any or at least adequate discussion I think it be well for the country that there be a body of Members determine to deal with the Estimates a they ought to be dealt with I beg to move the reduction of this Vote by Under ordinary circumstance I should be exceedingly sorry to see the amount this House vote for the purpose of instruction reduce by one farthing I be anxious to increase the amount we vote for the instructive and constructive force and to diminish the sum which we vote for the destructive force By the present reduction I desire to protest a I have do for the last three or four year against the system of sweat which obtain in our Government institution I complain last week of the system of contract for human labour which be in force in this building The same system obtain in the British Museum and in the Admiralty Department and I say last week I should feel it to be my duty to continue to move reduction upon these Votes until our natural and just request be accede to I find I make a mistake last week I be too generous towards the Government contractor I say that the contractor supply certain plant and tool and that in consideration of this they be allow to make certain deduction of from to per cent from the wage of the I find however that the plant and tool be supply by the Office of Works and therefore there be not the slight justification in the world for the continuance of this system of sweat and I shall be exceedingly glad to know from the right Gentleman the ground upon which these contractor be allow to make these deduction from the wage of their Now in addition to cleaner duster gardener and others who perform menial work at the British Museum and who be employ through contractor These be also the men employ in the catalogue department and these men too be subject to the sweating system have for year be permit to supply a number of workman and boy in the catalogue department of the British Museum THE CHAIRMAN That be not relevant to this Vote Then I shall be under the painful necessity of move another reduction later on I simply refer to the state of thing in the catalogue in pass to show that Brass be not the only contractor at the British Museum who make large deduction from the wage of the men they employ I have to complain that since I have bring this question forward two or three year ago the right Gentleman the First Commissioner of Works have enter into another contract I believe it have be make for three year with Brass Therefore I can not content myself with indefinite promise on the part of the right Gentleman that he will consider the grievance of these workman I want a distinct assurance from the right Gentleman that when the present contract cease he personally will enter into no further contract either with Brass or anyone else Of course he can not pledge his successor but if he will give a distinct pledge that the system of which I complain and the grievance under which these men labour shall be end so far a he be concern I shall be perfectly satisfy and will not press my Amendment to a Division Motion make and Question propose That Item B of for the Maintenance and Repairs be reduce by The Member have in his opening remark say that the nation be to be congratulate in the way in which a handful of Members be determine to thresh out the Estimates item by item Possibly that may be the Member view but I hold a different opinion I think the public be turn away with weariness and disgust from the proceeding of this House Withdraw because of the way in which comparatively unimportant matter be discuss at great length and the public time be deliberately waste I be not speak of the action of the Member on this special occasion but I refer to the duct of a handful of Members who a they openly tell u be determine to thresh out the Estimates item by item And now I wish to deal with the particular point the Gentleman have raise and which he have state with fairness Let me in the first place remind the Committee what happen on the last occasion when I think the subject be bring forward by the Member for Northampton The Member suggest that I should make some endeavour to rectify the grievance complain of in regard to labourer and others employ within this House and he point out that here we have special opportunity for rectify the grievance because we have a staff of officer by whose assistance it would be more easy than it would be in other place to carry out some change I promise the Member for Northampton that so far a this particular set of be concern I would do my best to find out some way of escape from the apparent anomaly which exist here But that be a comparatively small question to the one the Member for have now raise What do the Member expect me to do The contract with Brass for general maintenance and repair must run for two year Even suppose I admit to the full which I do not all the statement of the Member I have no power to interfere There be no use in give a vague promise that I will enter into no such contract in future What I have undertake to do and it be the utmost any Minister can be expect to do be that when this contract terminate the whole question of such employment by the Government shall be as carefully a possible consider with a view to give as far a we can effect to the very natural feeling which have be express namely that no advantage should be take of Government contract to the injury of those who may be employ under the contract This be a very difficult matter to deal with I have always understand that the system of contract by open competition be admit almost universally a true sound system upon which this kind of Government business should be transact and it be impossible for me to say it shall be change until the question have be go into carefully a I promise it shall be I trust that under the circumstance the Member will not think it necessary to go to a Division WILLIAMS Glamorgan I think the right Gentleman have rather confuse the matter We be not now deal with large work of construction but with what may be call the domestic part of our Administration with the daily work of the ordinary labourer employ by the State As I understand my Friend he desire that the in Government institution should be pay first hand just a we in our own farm or place of business pay the people we employ When we be charge with waste public time because we inquire into these apparently minor matter I have to answer the right Gentleman that I have look to the record for a year or two and I find that time after time objection have be make and meet in the same way a they have today I declare when I find this so often repeat I feel tempt to interfere a good deal more in the future in these matter I have look at the report of the proceeding last year and I find the same objection meet with the same dilatory answer that the matter should be look into Now if the question be a difficult one that be no reason why it should not be grapple with it will not become easy by be put off to have a categorical answer yea or nay to the question we put Unless we have a decided promise that every contract when it end shall not be renew by the right Gentleman if he be in office then a I hope he may not be then I hope my Friend will divide the House on this question GRAHAM I do not wish to trespass on the time of the Committee but I be rather at a loss to understand whether a private Member be at liberty to moot such question a this if in Committee of Supply he be to be accuse of waste time when he do so The First Lord of the Treasury seem to indicate a short time ago that Members who put down Motions deal with matter of this kind be simply do so with a desire to obstruct public business in order to prevent the Government get Supply and now after a very indefinite promise it be expect that this matter shall not be pursue Now I should like to know what all this investigation into the system of sweat by the Committee of the other House be to result in We do not spend so much money and occupy so much of the valuable time of noble Lords simply in order to publish a Report and I fail to see how a system we all condemn when exercise by private firm should be condone when exercise by ourselves in our collective capacity It be about time I think that we set an example in our State Departments If we be not go to set the example ourselves we have no right to point the finger of scorn at firm who be call sweater upon evidence that come out before the Committee sit in another place What be we to understand in this matter Are we always to be behind every other corporate body that exist in the Kingdom upon this matter The County Council and the School Board of London be no sooner elect than they endeavour to grapple with the matter although they have not the authority we have They have pass resolution deal with kindred matter to this Are we the House of Commons ever to be Letting I dare not wait upon I would Like the poor cat i the adage I be exceedingly glad that the Member represent a constituency have see fit to move in this matter and he have my hearty support in what he have say I venture to hope that all future contract will be most severely overhauled and if possible not only the hour of labour will be carefully limit by the Government and the condition make such a will not only satisfy capitalist and the State but that the condition a affect the men who do the work will be consider Northampton I should not have rise but that I do not think the remark of the right Gentleman should be allow to pass unnoticed The right Gentleman objection and there be something in the objection be that these discussion take item after item will make the work of the Committee impossible in the House of Commons Yes but if that be so what be our discussion of Supply to be I agree that with the huge number of Votes to be dispose of that if this kind of attention be give to each vote it will render it impossible to take the whole number of Votes through Committee within the allotted Parliamentary time but be there to be no discussion at all Is it because the work will become impossible there shall be no such critical examination of expenditure Does not the answer of the First Commissioner amount to this that an investigation should be conduct by a number of small Committees deal with these vote before they be submit to the Committee of the House Would not that avoid waste of the time of the House on each individual item The Government have the mean of set up such machinery We have not have the same amount of investigation a take place last year Several Committees sit last year and we be much indebted to their labour though the Committees be I think too large and necessarily occupy too much time to be useful in settle the current Estimates for the year A number of small Committees deal with these Votes would do the work much well and there would then be no complaint of undue encroachment on the time by elaborate discussion in Committee of the House I can understand the feeling of the right Gentleman wait here hour after hour for the passing of Votes to which he do not attribute so much importance a some Members do but I do not think his language be justified though I feel the difficulty of his position Much of the old passing of Estimates in this House be in the nature of a farce and I do not even now believe it be in our power to reduce a Vote Our discussion be solely useful a illustrate some grievance either against individual or a system which we have no mean of raise otherwise I trust the right Gentleman in consideration for such Members a myself will reconsider his censure for I may truly plead that at no time and under no circumstance have I ever try to waste the time of the House or the Committee but I conceive that I have a duty not to allow this to pass without challenge I trust that the right Gentleman may see fit to modify his phrase about weariness and disgust I rise without a moment hesitation to assure the Member that I have no notion of refer to him and that I think of all Members sit opposite he be perhaps least open to any such charge What I say be simply in answer to what appear to me the most misleading general statement of the Member for and I do not refer to the course take in this instance I expressly say on a previous occasion that this whole question should be consider but that it be impossible for me to rescind or largely to modify these contract While I repeat my statement on the general question of obstruction I wish to make it perfectly clear I do not for a moment question the right of the Committee to discuss any item with the bona intention of bring into prominence some particular view What I deprecate be a system that would make it impossible to get through the Estimates properly at all As to the suggestion that some class of the Estimates should be consider in a preliminary way by small Committees there be in my opinion much to be say in favour of that Once again let me say that I have not the slight intention of make any reference to the Member for Northampton who have just speak what I say be on account of the general statement of the Member for Finsbury I be glad the right Gentleman have somewhat amend the statement in his first speech We can only use the machinery at our disposal for criticize the rule submit to u We be not responsible for that machinery If it be cumbersome then no Government could be good employ than in it improvement and in provide some method for facilitate this examination of Estimates and forward the business of the House The right Gentleman do not seem to have clearly grasp the position take up by my Friend he seem to confuse the question of contract such a these with contract in which the contractor have to supply technical knowledge and skilled labour a large staff and plant These contract we be discuss be merely contract for the employment of unskilled labour that might easily be direct by officer of the Department What would be think of a proposal to carry out this system to the extent of provide a librarian or attendant in the Library of the British Museum Offer such employment to contract and the thing become ridiculous at once But except in degree of employment the relation be the same between such the Department and others employ about the building Our objection be clearly define We object to this let out of labour to contract when there be no work for the contractor to do no supervision no expenditure upon plant no capital and when no knowledge or skill whatever be bring to bear Surely there be a clear distinction between give cut contract such a these and give out contract for work such a erect a building or building a ship All we want be a clear statement that the Government have arrive at an opinion that this system of contract for human labour be wrong We have make up our mind and intend to force home our opinion for we know the importance of this matter to those employ under the system No contradiction have be give to my statement last week that a week be in some instance deduct from a man wag Can Members imagine what this mean Some of u have have to work for a weekly wage and know what a serious inroad on much large earnings than these men get such a deduction be We have call attention to the evil of the system we tell you from practical experience that direct employment can be give that the effect of these contract be serious deduction from the men wage and we ask that the Treasury shall declare that the system shall not go on when present contract have cease FOWLER Wolverhampton I quite agree with the Member who have just speak that we can only make the best use of the machinery at our disposal but I also think that we be responsible for the mode in which we use it for make it effective in a practical manner The Member have clearly draw the distinction between the two class of contract which I think the First Commissioner will appreciate These contract simply mean that the officer of the Board of Works be save from the trouble of employ this unskilled labour but at the expense of the wage of the men who do the work The right Gentleman say that the point be not bring to his attention last year but he be aware that a Committee of the Lords have be sit for the last twelve month and public attention have be draw to the evil of what be call the sweating system in a manner it have never be call before I think the time have come when the House of Commons should make it voice effectively hear on the subject I be happy to say that the Committee engage on the work of build the Imperial Institute have pass a resolution declare that in no part of the building shall the sweating system be allow I see the difficulty of the First Commissioner there be exist contract that must be allow to run out Now a I understand a week ago he invite an expression of opinion from the Committee whether these contract should be renew on their present basis Well owe to the unfortunate mode in which our decision be take Gentlemen crowd in to take part in a Division and know nothing of the condition of the question many Members vote entirely against their own conviction and desire They think it be an ordinary Motion to reduce the Government Vote and they vote in support of the Government I will venture to say that have it be really understood that it be not a question of a substantial reduction of a Vote but the expression of an opinion that the Government have ask for and which the House be prepare to give disapproving of the sweating system and declare that as soon a it could reasonably be do an end should be put to it in relation to the work in Government Departments then I think the number in the Division would have be very different But let me point out to the Members who be move in this matter that I do not think any particular good will result from take a Division on this Vote We have make our protest and ask that the First Commissioner should pledge himself that he will not renew these contract without the distinct approval of the House of Commons Having that I think we may be satisfy It will solve the difficulty and prevent the question arise on subsequent Votes if the right will promise that a Select Committee shall be appoint to consider the whole question of these contract before they be renew A fairly representative Committee will come to a far good conclusion than the official of the Board of Works My sympathy be strongly with the Member for The sweating system be one of the great evil of the day and we should condemn it in whatever shape or form we find it I invite the right Gentleman to terminate this controversy by promise the Select Committee to which I have refer I should like to remove one misapprehension under which the right Gentleman labour What I say the other day be that I invite an expression of opinion a regard the person employ about the Houses of Parliament for I felt that if this House think these person should be employ directly by the Government and not through a contractor that be a question on which their view ought to have exceptional weight But a to the general question of these contract for maintenance and repair of all Government building that be not so easy a problem to solve a some Members seem to suppose It have always until now be think that it be the best and most economical arrangement to invite contractor by open competition to undertake work and pain be take to secure that the contractor employ should be respectable and solvent and then we hold him responsible for the work Another reason why the Government have be oblige in deal with those public building in London to employ a contractor be that there sometimes occur sudden exigency which require the put on of a number of hand and engage an amount of labour which my Department have no machinery for call together for a short job which must be do at once except at grievous expense to the country The workman whose case I represent be not casual hand but have be engage many of them from five to year I be reply on the general question raise by the right Gentleman the Member for Wolverhampton Fowler who ask if I be prepare to state that the principle of carry out these by contract should be abandon and I be state some of the difficulty in the way Again we must realize this that as soon a the Government become the direct employer of this labour pressure will be put upon them at every point in deal with the men You can not dismiss a man or engage another man in place of one who fall sick without pressure be bring to bear by Members of Parliament or through them on the Government to do this or that I do not mean to say that such representation make might not in some case be fair and just but I do mean to say that the pressure which might be bring to bear by Members in many instance might not be beneficial and not in favour of economical expenditure Other difficulty would arise with which I will not now delay the Committee I have however undertake that the whole matter shall be fully and fairly review and that when the contract expire it shall not be renew without the Government be prepare to justify the ground on which they act Every word use in this debate shall be carefully weigh and consider I can not pledge myself that no new contract shall be enter into but the whole nature of the service and the engagement of labourer to carry out the work shall be carefully and fully go into again I can give no pledge until there have be this examination for I do not know how the difficulty of the case can be meet but I think the pledge I have give should satisfy Members SYDNEY BUXTON Tower Hamlets Poplar I be sorry the right Gentleman be not able to meet u half way I think my Friend would be willing to accept the suggestion of the right Gentleman the Member for Wolverhampton and if the Government would promise that before the contract come to an end an impartial Select Committee shall be appoint to inquire into the whole question the difficulty would be meet and both side of the House will be satisfy There be difficulty in the way of work without these contract that be admit if there be not there would be no need for this discussion What we ask for be something more than a mere official promise upon which absolute reliance can not always be place though I quite acknowledge that the right Gentleman and the Secretary to the Treasury have every desire to carry out what they undertake The appointment of a Select Committee would be satisfactory I think on both side and our unanimous decision would be an earnest of the intention of the House of Commons to tolerate no introduction of the sweating system into Government work THE SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY JACKSON Leeds I should like to satisfy Members that the promise of my right Friend be not what be call the mere usual official promise The question be one which contain a good many difficulty and since it be raise a week ago it have be the subject of very grave consideration by the First Commissioner of Works and by the Leader of the House and his colleague I think everyone must admit it be extremely desirable to avoid define those particular case to which the Member for refers If the men have be employ continuously for twenty year I do not say all I say many JACKSON Those case I should think it would be perfectly simple and easy to meet I have give some personal consideration to this question and have have some experience in deal with question of organization and with work men The position in which we find ourselves appear to me to be one which have be force upon u by the action of Members of this House I do not say whether wisely or unwisely and by the very strong desire which have be express in recent year that everything should be do as cheaply a possible and as far a possible under the severe light of open and public competition I do not know whether the Member for have see the schedule of price frame by my right Friend the First Commissioner of Works That schedule contain a list of every article that can possibly be require by the Department a the result of the experience of a great many year and the Office of Works by mean of it expert officer have attach to the schedule the price which be believe to be the market price Included in the schedule be the price of labour for different class of work It seem to be almost impossible without commit the gross extravagance to avoid call in outside labour to do particular kind of work but I think the whole tendency be in favour of all work for which a separate tender can be obtain be put up to public competition All extra labour which be of a kind that require constant employment may of course be meet by add to the staff of the Office of Works and probably the class of men to whom the Member have refer would come within that category but when the Office of Works be call upon in an emergency or require for a short time a number of men belong to a particular trade it would be the gross extravagance to keep them upon it staff after they have do the work require of them I think a solution of the difficulty will probably be find in add to the permanent staff what I will call the minimum number of men who be require to discharge certain duty call in from the outside on reasonable term such a may be necessary to meet exceptional demand What however I really rise to say be that the Member may be assure that my right Friend in give the assurance which the House have hear have not do so lightly The matter have be under the consideration of the Ministers of the Crown and I think the Committee will admit that whilst it may relieve the Government of a great many difficulty it be the duty of my right Friend and his Department in the first instance to consider whether they can find a satisfactory solution I be sorry that the suggestion make by the right Gentleman the Member for Wolverhampton Fowler have not be accede to by the Government I have not yet exhaust the information which have be supply to me nor have I make out a bad a case a I could have present I could prove to the Committee that per cent have be deduct from the wage of workman and per cent from those of boy I do not myself suggest the appointment of a Committee because a great deal of the information that have be supply to me have be supply by the men themselves who have a great fear that their name may be divulge They have in fact tell me they have be threaten that if they make any statement they will be discharge from their employment and they therefore approach the consideration of the subject with fear and tremble The evil I complain of be however so general extend to the Admiralty and the British Museum and I fear to other Government Departments that I shall be quite willing to accept an offer on the part of the Government to inquire into them and I hope that these poor men will run no risk in the future by state their case The necessity for some inquiry will be apparent to anyone who have hear the conflicting statement make by the right Gentleman It seem to me that the right Gentleman do not understand the difference between ordinary and extraordinary contract We do not object to the ordinary but only to the extraordinary contract The right Gentleman say the question be surround with a great deal of difficulty It seem to me however that he be not quite the proper authority to express an opinion upon that point or to get rid of the evil to which reference have be make A Committee of Inquiry might possibly help the right Gentleman to a solution of the problem and to remove from his mind the prejudice which I fear still lingers there and which render a solution in the interest of the men almost impossible If the right Gentleman will state that between now and the time when the Admiralty Vote come on the Government will seriously consider the advisability of assent to the suggestion make by the right Gentleman the Member for Wolverhampton Fowler I shall not on the present occasion press my Amendment to a Division I have endeavour to meet the right Gentleman in an impartial spirit and I hope he will meet u in the same manner I think the Member will see that I could not give the undertaking which he ask for without consult my right Friend the Leader of the House Smith and the Members of the Government I can assure the Member that it will be a great relief to me personally to have the responsibility of settle this question take off my shoulder I can however under present circumstance only say that I will submit his suggestion to my colleague If they should come to a conclusion unfavourable to his contention it will of course be in his power to raise the question again on a future occasion Under the circumstance I shall with the permission of the Committee withdraw my Amendment Amendment by leave withdraw Original Question again propose GARDNER Essex Saffron Walden I wish to ask the right Gentleman the First Commissioner of Works whether any decision have be come to with regard to extend the electric lighting in the British Museum and also with regard to open the Museum at night JACKSON It have be decide to extend the electric lighting in the British Museum and to make the experiment of leave the Museum open at night SIR CAMPBELL I understand that a promise be make that the first experiment in opening after nightfall be to be in the Natural History Museum JACKSON No it be not SIR CAMPBELL Well word be use which almost amount to a promise Before I sit down I want to make one protest against the philippic with which the right Gentleman commence the discussion in reference to the allege obstruction of the proceeding of the House It seem to me that the occasion choose by the right Gentleman for make that speech be singularly inappropriate Yesterday Members in their generosity assist the Government to the point of dereliction of duty and allow a large number of Votes to pass without one word in order to facilitate the progress of the business of the House Cornwall This be not the first time that the right Gentleman have choose to deliver a philippic against u on the score of obstruction We protest against such insinuation I be last night only absent from the House for a short time and I be perfectly alarm when I come back and find how much progress have be make It may be very pleasant for the Government to rush through the Estimates but it be not the business of Members to allow Vote after Vote to be without consideration Mid I wish to know whether the Item for Official Residences in this Vote be a very heavy one There be no exceptional change this year in connection with the Official Residences I wish to ask the right Gentleman a question with reference to the supply of furniture and article of a domestic character I want to know who supply the furniture Last year there be some suspicion that the furniture be supply by some particular firm who be favour with the order of the Government and a pledge be give that in future the various furniture contractor should be invite to supply it by tender I should like to know whether that promise have be fulfil and whether the same principle applies to all other Government Departments I promise last year that I would make out a list of firm who might tender I have such a list make but I have never be ask to produce it to the House Preston The point be this Is the supply of furniture open to competition or not An Member who be connect with a very large firm have tell me that that firm be never allow to be put on the list and it seem to me that the list be found too much on favouritism We be only too glad to have the competition of all the good firm I can now if it be desire give the name of the firm that have be invite to tender and I shall be glad to add the name of any other firm that the Member may suggest I hear with some amazement that the system though an improvement on the old one be still that of a close corporation and that the firm place on the list be select All the firm should in my opinion be invite to tender Does the right Gentleman refuse to state that consider the possibility of advertising in the ordinary manner so that all the firm may tender If so will he give u any satisfactory reason why he consider that can not be do Any firm of any strength or solvency that apply to u shall be add to the list but I do no care about throw the matter open to public competition because we then might have tender from insolvent firm Question put and agree to Motion make and Question propose That a sum not exceed be grant to Her Majesty to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year end on the day of March for Diplomatic and Consular Buildings include Rents and Furniture and for the maintenance of certain Cemeteries Abroad Northampton I think we be entitle to complain of the large sum require for the Embassy House at Paris and it be a question whether we be wise in buy such building I think we ought to make proper allowance to our Ministers abroad and leave them to take what house they like and furnish them for themselves I have no complaint to make of Lord personally but I find that whenever a new Ambassador be appoint he be not content with the Embassy House a he find it but require structural improvement which be very costly In this case there be three item for structural repair for ordinary maintenance and repair and for renewal of decoration and furniture I do not know whether the Committee be aware that when a gentleman be appoint au Ambassador he receive an outfit But for what do he receive It It be in order that he may do up his house and make all necessary arrangement for occupy it I think we ought to put our foot down upon this constantly recur expenditure for alteration and repair If we give our Ambassador a house he ought to take it a it be and do all that be necessary to repair and maintain it have a it be a kind of repair lease while he remain in it The Embassy House at Paris be a very fine and large building and cost the country an enormous sum of money If sell or let it would realize or per annum For my part if I could I would do away with Ambassadors everywhere but under any circumstance I do not think it be necessary to expend a large sum of money in keep up house for them I beg to move the reduction of the Vote by the sum of in respect of the Embassy at Paris Motion make and Question propose That Item I Paris of be reduce by Mr WILLIAMS Glamorgan Can the First Commissioner of Works give the Committee any idea of what the original cost of the house be be require this year to keep it in repair but what be the original cost I can not at this moment give the original cost The date of the purchase go back as far a But with regard to the point raise by the Member for Northampton it be no doubt a question whether our Embassies generally should be provide with house or have an allowance give them to provide house for themselves But there be some capital in which all be agree that our Ambassadors should have house provide for them and such a capital be Paris The French have provide their Ambassadors in every great capital with house to live in and represent the country at the same time As to the increase of the charge for the Embassy at Paris it arise from the circumstance that the late Lord Lyons be a man of very simple habit and he only make use of a very small part of the Embassy House It be discover when his successor be appoint that even the room which Lord Lyons have inhabit be in a very bad state of repair I think it right to send over to Paris two of my most experienced surveyor and it be find that a great part of the house be in an absolutely dangerous condition and be almost fall to piece Very considerable structural repair be necessary a to several of the floor and ceiling The timber in some part be find to be seriously affect by dry rot That be the real explanation of the increased charge for repair Members may rest satisfy that the great possible care have be take to reduce the expense MUNRO FERGUSON Burghs The right Gentleman have give the Committee a description of the repair which have be execute and it would appear that nothing have be do which be not actually necessary It be absolutely necessary that a large amount of money should be expend in order to prevent the decay of this very fine building which be buy at the Peace of Paris I believe that it be true economy to maintain the building property and I shall be glad to support the Vote Lancashire Newton Speaking from some experience I may say that unless a considerable sum be spend upon this building it would in a short time tumble to piece The only alternative plan to the voting of large sum of money for structural repair be that the present site should be sell a good a site might be obtain elsewhere Personally however I should be very reluctant to part with the present Embassy House which both in it situation and in every other respect be suitable to all requirement I hope that the Committee will not be delude by the argument which have be advanced My Friend say that this a very old house and something must be do every year to keep it in order The Committee ought to know however that a sum of a year have be devote every year to the maintenance of this house for a long term of year By refer to the Estimate the Committee will perceive that a sum of be require for the renewal of decoration and furniture and last year a similar sum be expend for the same purpose include ordinary maintenance and repair Surely that sum ought to have be sufficient to keep the house go and if dry rot have get into the building somebody ought to be punish for it What become of the money spend every year for ordinary maintenance and repair and the renewal of decoration and furniture The fact be a I have say that these house cost too much If you spend per annum in keep a house in structural repair it ought to be sufficient Whenever a new Ambassador be send out upon a new mission there be always this expenditure In this case we be tell it be the dry rot but it be the Ambassador The Member opposite have throw out an excellent suggestion namely that we shall sell this house if we can get for it In that event I should be willing to enter into a contract to lodge the Ambassador and lodge him well for a year The whole of this extra expenditure be due to the change of Ambassador and I think we ought to protest against it When an Ambassador be appoint he get an outfit of to enable him to purchase spoon but it be a sum which really go into his pocket and in my opinion it ought to be do away with WILLIAMS I should like to have some account of the cost of the German Embassy in London and the cost of keep an Ambassador here The charge impose upon the country for our Ambassadors be in my opinion perfectly monstrous We not only give our Ambassador at Paris a house but we allow him a year to maintain it and keep it in repair That ought to be an ample allowance Pancras I have have the opportunity of have considerable experience in maintain large house and I think it be a wise policy to buy house and not to rent them The Embassy House at Paris be buy at an extremely low price and be now of far great value than the price we pay for it It be suggest that we should sell it That be not the principle on which we ought to proceed Our Ambassador at Paris ought undoubtedly to be suitably lodge and for keep up this particular house be by no mean excessive Moreover it must be remember that the expenditure do not depend on the Ambassador but on the gentleman send over from the Office of Works who have to decide from time to time what ought to be do I think the sum ask for be moderate and I do not think the matter be one which ought to be deal with in a niggardly spirit GARDNER Essex Saffron Walden Allow me to point out that the principal part of the Vote be for structural repair and alteration and only for ordinary maintenance and repair I agree with the Member behind me that it would be much good to purchase Ambassadorial residence than to hire them I be afraid that the Member for Northampton would find it very expensive to hire residence for our Ambassadors It be much well that the house should as far a possible be purchase and not hire SIR CAMPBELL There be one weak point in the argument of the Member for South Pancras Sir Although a year may not be an excessive sum to pay for ordinary maintenance and repair it ought to be sufficient if properly apply without necessitate further expenditure The Committee divide Ayes Noes List No Original Question again propose Northampton The next item in this Vote be for the Embassy at Rome and here we have another Ambassador who be put the country to extra expenditure The ordinary expenditure be for maintenance and repair of the an Embassy but here we have a charge of for renewal of furniture and decoration and a further charge of for a new entrance and approach to the Embassy House I have watch this outlay in Rome for some time If I remember rightly when our first Minister go there the charge be a year for a house But in course of time he become an Ambassador and a a matter of course an Ambassador have a large salary want to spread himself out It be then think necessary that he should have a special house and we first of all buy the site and the ground We give a large amount for the site and devote a large amount for the house Then we decorate the house and furnish it After that the Ambassador cast his eye on a garden that which be attach to the house not be deem large enough Then it be say that there be a wood near the garden and somebody might build a house in the wood that would overlook the garden and now we have the result of all this in the approach I through the wood I think the time have come when a stop must be put to all this and when we must bring home to the Foreign Office the necessity of tell our Ambassadors when they be send out to their Embassies that they must really accommodate themselves to the house and not have the house rearrange in order that it may be accommodate to them The expenditure here be very large this year be in excess of the ordinary outlay I remember that when we buy the house we be tell it be structurally so well build and that the furniture be so excellent that we have make a great bargain and we should not be call on to spend any large sum of money on either for year to come and yet in a very few year we be call on to spend for renewal of furniture and decoration All this be mere waste and I for one do not share the opinion of the Chief Commissioner of Works that the country look with indignation on those who move reduction of the Estimates I do not know what the view of those who send the right Gentleman and Gentlemen on the other side of the House to Parliament may be but I know that portion of the people of this country who send Radical Members to Parliament rather like u to look into the Estimates I be not go merely to swallow gnat I be go to strain at camel and gnat too and the view I take be the view of my constituent If it be not I should think it my duty to educate them to that view The only way in which we can induce the Government to meet u in these matter be by constantly call attention to them not perhaps by take Divisions because we never win a Division against the Government but we know that if we keep to our point whenever an Ambassador want to make au extra expenditure the Government say to him Pray do not ask for it or we shall be have a great deal of bother with those miserable Radicals I beg to move Sir that this Vote be reduce by the sum of Motion make and Question propose That Item Rome of be reduce by Mr There have undoubtedly be the increase which have be point out in this Vote but I think I can satisfy the Committee that it be necessary The fact be that the Embassy House at Rome happen to be in a part of the city in which there have of late year be a great deal of improvement and building go on and the entrance which have hitherto be in the front be in a very narrow street and be find under the altered circumstance to be neither convenient nor suitable for those who have business at the Embassy That be the reason why this extra expenditure in regard to the entrance have be incur With regard to what the Gentleman the Member for Northampton have say about the furniture it must be remember that that furniture be buy twelve year ago and that be a considerable period As the matter have be carefully look into by the Surveyor I hope the Committee will agree that the expenditure have be necessary and will refuse to accept the Amendment SIR CAMPBELL On the last occasion I vote with the Member for Northampton on the general principle when in doubt vote against the Government On this occasion I can not vote with him for I consider this a very moderate sum charge for the Embassy in Rome in connection with which there be no unnecessary ostentation Now when I go to see the Ambassador I must say that the approach to the Embassy be not of an extensive or ostentatious character in fact when I come to the door I hesitate to knock thinking I have make a mistake and that it be not the door of the Ambassador I do not think an expenditure of or be a large amount to spend upon the entrance to the Embassy in the country of our good Allies the Italians Twelve year ago we spend in make that door and now we have to spend on another new door in order that my Friend may walk through it I hope there be no attempt at a covert attack by hospitality on the virtue of my Friend But I be very much afraid that it be the case I be bring up in the Diplomatic Service and we be always pester at that time by Englishmen come and they use to have letter from the Foreign Office We use to call them soup ticket We use to give them a dinner We find that if we do not give them a dinner there be some trouble in the House of Commons I hope my Friend have not be seduce from that stern virtue which characterize him by one of these soup ticket We have before u for the last year all the expenditure in regard to these Embassies The Chief Commissioner of Works admit that this expenditure would not have be incur but for the change of Ambassadors I believe it be admit that while Lord be at Rome he keep a very good Embassy but if an Ambassador chooses to have an extra number of child or servant I do not see why the country should pay for them I suppose what be sufficient for the late Ambassador ought to be sufficient for the present OSBORNE MORGAN I too have be to Rome and like my Friend I go to the British Embassy I can assure the Member that I do not enjoy and therefore be in no way corrupt by the hospitality which he seem so much afraid of But I be bound to say that there be a general opinion among the English there that their Embassy be the shabby in the place I do not think the expenditure be at all extravagant and that it meet strictly the need of the case TANNER Cork Mid Before this be put might I draw a comparison between the expenditure at Washington and that at Rome The expenditure we be call upon to pass in connection with the Embassy at Rome be when we turn to Washington the capital of the United States I think that the simplicity which be practise in Washington should be observe at our other Embassies in the interest of the taxpayer of this country The Committee divide Ayes Noes List No Original Question again propose SHAW Bradford I wish to call attention to the item of for build a new Consulate a Tangier I observe that the old building be expect to fetch I have never be to Tangier but I have always be lead to believe that the Legation be one of the best house in the place and perfectly suitable for the Consul General who reside there It have be occupy for many year by Sir Henry Drummond Hay Inasmuch a last year the Committee reject a proposal for build a new Legation at Cairo in place of the present one and a I understand the present Legation at Tangier be a very good one I move the reduction of the Vote by the sum of for the purpose of give the First Commissioner an opportunity of explain the item Motion make and Question propose That Item Tangier be omit from the propose Vote Shaw It be quite clear from the Report of the Surveyor a most trustworthy and competent public servant who have report on this building at that it would be impossible to oblige the Minister to reside in the old house in it present state The Surveyor report that it be surround by high building that some of the outhouse and the gaol be in an insanitary condition that the office accommodation be insufficient and that structurally it be not capable of improvement that there be no suitable house or site to be have inside the town and the only alternative therefore be to purchase a site and build a house on the high ground outside That will cost about but that sum will be reduce by the which it be expect will be obtain for the old building I may mention that Sir Drummond Hay have reside in a villa of his own outside the town while Consul General there and do not live at the Consulate except for about one month in the winter SHAW I do not wish to press the Motion Motion by leave withdraw Original Question again propose SYDNEY BUXTON Tower Hamlets Poplar I should like to ask the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs a question a to the meaning of Subhead T under which there seem to have be a large purchase of land adjoin the site of the Consulate of Zanzibar Does it mean that Her Majesty Government be go to have a large Consulate in consequence of their increased activity in that part of the world MUNRO FERGUSON The item for a new building at Tangier be a large one and I can not help think that every argument that can be adduce in favour of the State provide a permanent residence for it Ministers in North Africa apply much more strongly to the building at Cairo than to that at Tangier There have be an amount of on the part of Her Majesty Government in their policy in regard to the establishment of a suitable residence for our Consul General at Cairo which be not inconsistent with the character of their general policy in Egypt A site be buy for a new residence but it be not make use of no building be erect upon it The French Consul in Cairo live in a palace whilst ours have to hire a building a best he may and altogether if there be a central locality in which it be desirable for the British Representative to live in respectable style and where it be desirable that we should build a residence for him I should select Cairo a that locality With regard to the Consulate at Zanzibar I should like to ask whether it be maintain there for any useful purpose We see that Count Herbert Bismarck have just pay a visit to this country and that Colonel Smith have be recall on leave doubtless to consult Her Majesty Government a to our policy in Zanzibar THE CHAIRMAN Order order The Member be not entitle on the question of Consular residence to enter into the policy pursue by Her Majesty Government MUNRO FERGUSON I be go to ask whether under the circumstance it be worth while maintain Consular building at all in that part of Africa However I will not pursue that matter any further SIR CAMPBELL In continuation of what have be say by my Friend a to the provision of a residence for the Consul General in Cairo I beg to say I be one of the last men anxious to make our residence in Egypt more permanent than it be at present I should like to see Her Majesty Government quit Egypt bag and baggage but whether we leave it or not we have important interest in that country and it be right that our Representative should be properly house Our Representative at Cairo live in a hired house of the of which he have reason to complain his wife and child have be ill there The French Consulate and I speak with knowledge on the matter have make a visit to Cairo be a magnificent palace and though I do not desire to see this country attempt to rival French magnificence I think it behove u to see that our Representative at Cairo have a proper and healthy residence Our position in Cairo be so difficult owe to the Capitulations and the difficulty of punish foreigner that it have be find impossible to establish a decent sanitary system there THE CHAIRMAN Order order SIR CAMPBELL I think I have show Sir that I be come to the point On account of the insanitary condition of Cairo the hired house there be all unhealthy Our Consul General live in one of these with the result I have mention I understand that a Vote be bring forward by the Government to test the willingness of the House to build a residence for the Consul General at Cairo and why that residence have not be build I do not know I do not wish to take up any position that would seem to imply that I favour extravagance but have be in Egypt and have visit the Consulate I do think there be a case for provide the Consul General with a respectable residence Aberdeenshire I be able to speak from some experience of the insanitary condition of the house in Cairo and especially of the house of Sir Baring which be something of the sepulchre class and which may one of these day contain dead men bone It be important that in Eastern country some decent state should be keep up SIR MARRIOTT Brighton Some time ago Sir Baring might have have a piece of land at a very reasonable cost but the opportunity pass and now he live in a very insanitary house Our Representative especially in such a country a Egypt ought to be as well house a the Representative of any other country FOWLER I trust that the Committee will not allow itself to be influence by Gentlemen who have be recently in Cairo and have probably enjoy the hospitality of Sir Baring The Member for must have forget his fact This question be raise several year ago and the Cabinet decide after most careful consideration that it would be unwise to build a house in Cairo A change of Government take place and negotiation be enter into for the purchase of a piece of land for but in view of the feeling in this House on the subject the Government decide not to build a house which decision meet with the approval of both side It be now seek by a sort of side wind to raise a question which really involve the subject of increase the Estimate This matter have come upon u with surprise With regard to it I hold a contrary opinion to the right Gentleman who have just sit down I believe these house be extravagant in their inception their completion and their maintenance I remember fight about the question of a house in Berlin We be assure that would be sufficient but the grow to and that to In every one of these case it would be far good to hire a house I be only express my own opinion in this matter but certainly this Cairo question be fully consider and settle on a previous occasion I will not go into the question of a new Consulate at Cairo which be not now the subject under debate that matter have already be discuss last year when it be for the time at least decide in deference to the strong expression of opinion on the part of the House As to Zanzibar the money ask for for the purchase of land have nothing whatever to do with the general policy of this country in that part of the world The Consulate be situate close to the shore There be a piece of land in front of it which if not acquire by u would be acquire by other people and if it be build on the sea breeze would be exclude from the Consulate which in that climate would render it impossible to occupy the house Edinburgh South I desire to ask a question a to the item for cemetery There have be some difficulty with the Italian authority in regard to the cemetery at Rome and the subject be one in which many Members of the House take great interest Will the Under Secretary of State be good enough to tell u whether the matter be satisfactorily settle UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS Sir Manchester In the course of municipal improvement in Rome it be think desirable that a broad road should be make which require for it completion that a part of the Protestant cemetery should be take Representations be make to the municipal authority on behalf of England and these be back up by Germany who have sympathy with the desire of this country to prevent the remains of Keats and Severn and other celebrated Englishmen from be disturb The Italian Government be appeal to and the municipality of Rome and eventually it be arrange that certain remains would be remove with all respect but that those of celebrated Englishmen would be enclose suitably and handsomely All difficulty be remove Her Majesty Government express their both to the Italian and German Governments in the matter for the assistance give in preserve memorial very dear to many people in this country York I should like to ask for an explanation of au Item under one of the of this Vote namely for the Consulate in the district at the Item be I be under the impression that there be no Consulate at and that there have not be one there for some time past As we be not likely to have one there in the immediate future I do not think the House should be ask to vote money in this way There be no intention to abolish the Consulate at It be somewhat of a Consulate in a we have no territorial jurisdiction and do not exercise a protectorate but it be think desirable to continue the Consulate in order to maintain law amongst the British resident of whom there be a small community which it be hop will continue to flourish The Consul be however temporarily employ at Zanzibar There be not only the ordinary Consular Courts there but also a Court and great additional labour have be throw upon the Consular staff owe to the blockade and the operation which have be carry out for the suppression of the Slave Trade CAMERON Glasgow College The impression prevail in Scotland that if ever a Consul could be want anywhere it be at There be no spot in the world where it be more important we should have a Consul than at and I think we ought to mark our disapprobation of the withdrawal of the Consul at such a juncture a the present by move to reduce the Vote I be able to give an explanation which will hap induce the Member not move his propose Amendment The Consul at have be allow a short and leave of absence and on come back to his post he have be place for a time at Zanzibar for the reason I have During his absence the duty of the Consulate at be ably discharge by the old and a most respected resident Buchanan It be very often necessary in remote place that Consuls should be temporarily replace by and respectable resident and I feel sure that British interest have not at all suffer by the temporary discharge of the duty by Buchanan The Member may rest assure that there be no intention of withdraw permanently the Consul CAMERON What be the status of Buchanan THE CHAIRMAN This discussion be quite irregular TANNER I should like some explanation of the item under Subhead THE CHAIRMAN Order That have be pass over The Member can not recur to it TANNER I should like your ruling Sir upon one point We have discuss the cost of the Embassy at Paris In the course of his remark the First Commissioner of Works make certain statement a to money spend upon the Paris Embassy While he be speak I go to the Library to look up certain fact and when I return I find the matter have be dispose of I should like to know whether it be not possible for me to lay the fact and figure I have collect before the Committee THE CHAIRMAN The Member can not recur to the item Original Question put and agree to to complete the sum for Harbours under the Board of Trade ELLIS Upon this Vote I should like to ask the Government whether they have yet make up their mind with regard to the completion of the Holyhead Harbour The work of construct the harbour have be go on for year and have cost the nation something over a million and a half sterling The harbour be a remarkably fine and even magnificent one It afford every year refuge to between and vessel but it be not yet finish and it want of completeness greatly lessen it value a a harbour of refuge It comprise acre but of these acre be render completely unavailable for ship during storm because the rock at the entrance have not be remove The clear away of these rock be part of the original design of the Government and I think it have be repeatedly urge not merely by the great Steamship Companies but by the engineer of the Government who have from time to time report on the harbour that the work should be take in hand I bring the question up two year ago and in reply the then Representative of the Board of Trade admit it would be a great advantage if the work could be complete in the manner suggest The present President of the Board of Trade Sir Hicks Beach last year in answer to a deputation admit it would be a great advantage if the work be to be undertake What I desire to ask the right Gentleman be whether the Government will undertake that the work shall be take in hand without delay It may be an expensive matter but the work will have to be do and the sooner the good The right Gentleman have say that Sir John estimate the cost of the work at I have it on very good authority that this be an exaggerated estimate and if the right Gentleman still adhere to Sir John Report I have to ask that he will lay it on the Table of the House so that it may be examine PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE Sir MICHAEL HICKS BEACH Bristol I be sorry I have nothing to add to what I say on this subject last year I do not at all deny that the removal of the rock would be an advantage to the harbour of refuge at Holyhead but I can not admit that the removal of them can be effect for as little a the Member supposes My predecessor in office obtain an estimate of the cost of the work and it amount to a quarter of a million sterling I can not recommend that the work should be undertake at such a cost a that I have no reason to suppose that the estimate of Sir John be too great but a I say to the deputation which wait upon me last year if anyone can show me any ground for believe that the work can be more cheaply do I shall be very glad to consider it The estimate be make before I go to the Board of Trade and I do not quite know the circumstance under which it be obtain TANNER Cork Mid I should like some explanation of the item of for the repair and maintenance of the wooden pier at Holyhead This seem to be an expenditure which have be incur annually and I should like to know how long it have to last Residing a I do in a seaport town where there be a large number of such wooden structure I know that they cost a good deal The expenditure of this money annually seem to me to be wilfully throw money away Northampton in the case of the Dover Harbour I see that the resident engineer get a house and salary and allowance amount to a year Besides this officer there be a and many other official We ought to be tell something about this resident engineer I do not see that at Holyhead there be a resident engineer but I find a harbour master instead who receive a year I should think the at Dover and his assistant could do all the work that be require HICKS BEACH The resident engineer at Dover have other work besides attend to the Pier But if the Member will look at the opposite page of the Estimates he will see that the Dover Pier more than pay for itself With regard to the by the Member for I be afraid that the expenditure of upon the wooden pier at be necessary though it may seem very heavy TANNER There be another item in regard to which I would like a word of explanation There be at Holyhead a Superintendent of Works who receive a year There be no work go on there Is this another sinecure for some supporter of Her Majesty Government HICKS BEACH Holyhead be a very expensive harbour to keep up The breakwater require continual watching and I be sure the salary of this gentleman be well earned Donegal All the item in this Vote seem to be very extravagant and to indicate a strong tendency towards jobbery I be perfectly certain that if there be no sum on the Estimates for the Holyhead Harbour the London and Rail way Company would find it incumbent upon them and to their interest to keep the harbour up It be no answer to u to say that Dover Harbour pay for itself If it pay so much good for u I see that be set down for repair to the harbour gas I suppose we may safely take the repair at therefore we actually pay a resident engineer for look after repair which do not cost more than If that be not monstrous I do not know what be Vote agree to Resolutions to be report Committee to sit again FOWLER I want to ask one question with reference to the for the convenience of Members which my right Friend the First Commissioner of Works say yesterday he be go to make in consequence of the alteration in Westminster Hall All the First Commissioners of Works for many year past have be smoker and therefore they have be predispose to take a favourable view of the representation make to them by Members who indulge in the habit of smoke a to the accommodation for smoker But there be many Members of the House who do not smoke and I should like to ask the First Commissioner of Works whether he will not have some compassion on such inferior being in any rearrangement he may make My right Friend the late First Commissioner of Works hold out to u the prospect of a new room in the Lobby lead to the House of Lords but he have no sooner make the promise than it be rescind and the room devote to the purpose of a Grand Committee There be really no reasonable accommodation for the and it have occur to me that the present Tea Room might be convert into a News Room and the present News Room turn into a Tea Room I know the right Gentleman be most anxious to promote the convenience of all section of Members but he always seem to be overcome by the argument of the Member for Northampton who sympathize with smoker and who be so powerful on such question a this I can speak quite impartially because I be at once a smoker and a tea drinker but I do protest against the suggestion that we should give up the Tea Room to my right Friend to read newspaper in We have a claim on that room and we give it up on account of the late Beresford Hope If the right Gentleman would desire to see the place where the smoker be send to he would realize the fact that the smoker be really bad off than the tea drinker I trust that if the right Gentleman do consult the tea drinker in any he will also consult the smoker and if I can act a a in the matter I shall he only too glad If it will facilitate a settlement of the matter I shall certainly avail myself of the invitation of the Member for Northampton I desire to consult with all the different section of Members and I will try to make the new room go as far a possible Cornwall I wish to recur to a question I put to the right Gentleman last night I find in the Estimate for the Houses of Parliament there be a charge of for oil lamp use in the building As far a I can reckon the cost ought not to exceed to The right Gentleman tell me the great cost arose from the fact that we have to hire the lamp I should like to know where the lamp be hire and what be pay for their hire I have ask for information and if the Member will put a question in the House on the subject I will be glad to answer it Cornwall Division I should like the right Gentleman to endeavour to improve the accommodation afford in the Ladies Dining Room The present accommodation for lady be extremely inadequate On one occasion when I be anxious to obtain the use of a table I find all the accommodation have be take up a long time previously There be no limit to the number of guest one Member may invite to dine in the room I do not complain of that but I think if there be any additional room to be place at the disposal of Members it be only fair to Members and their lady friend that some good accommodation for lady should be provide TANNER I think we be entitle to some answer on the subject raise by my Friend I very seldom enter the Ladies Dining Room until the present year Now I have sometimes to make use of the room and I invariably find the table be take up by supporter of Her Majesty Government I suggest that a book should be keep to show who be the monopolist of the table night after night It be Seven of the clock the debate stand adjourned King A new system of telephoning have be introduce for the purpose of warn ship in time of fog I suppose the Gentleman opposite Jackson have read of it in the paper and I should like to know if he can give the result of any experiment that have be try THE SECRETARY To THE TREASURY JACKSON Leeds I be afraid I can not give the Member any information with regard to the interesting matter refer to The administrative authority in this case be the Board of Trade and I be not in a position to enter upon it Vote agree to Northampton I propose a an Amendment to reduce this Vote by the amount devote to the Chief Secretary Lodge and Garden I find there be a considerable amount of expenditure under the Vote not only on the Chief Secretary Lodge but on the Lodge the Under Secretary House and the Private Secretary house and that there be item for fuel lighting furniture and and so on I believe there be a good deal of abuse in this system The right Gentleman the President of the Board of Trade Sir Michael Hicks Beach who be Chief Secretary for Ireland and whom I see in his place will be able to give u some information on this subject in all probability I believe that when a gentleman be appoint to the office of Chief Secretary he have to pay or something like it PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE Sir HICKS BEACH Bristol That be formerly the practice but it have be abolish I be glad to hear that but that be an additional reason for my move the Amendment I do not know the practice be abolish and think that in some way or other the amount pay by the Chief Secretary be a set off against the item in the Vote of which I be complain It seem that since the Conservative Government come into office for I believe the Liberal Chief Secretary pay the money the practice of charge the incoming official have be abolish and I believe that during the great part of the tenure of office of the present Chief Secretary he have lend his lodge to somebody else This be not a I understand it the object for which house be grant for public official If the Chief Secretary use it well and good but surely he should not be allow to lend it to somebody else Lending and let be very much the same thing so far a the public be concern The gentleman in occupation be use up the carpet and burn the fuel and I think we ought to make a strong protest against the system Perhaps my Friend behind me intend to move a reduction in regard to the expenditure on the Deputy Secretary house the Private Secretary house and the other residence I do not raise those matter but I do object to this sum be spend on a house for the Chief Secretary when the Chief Secretary lend the house to a friend I beg to move the reduction that stand in my name Motion make and question propose That a sum not exceed be grant for the say service Mr Courtney the prospect which my Friend have hold out of my propose a reduction be a little too alarm for me for it would be the first time I have take part in anything like obstruction and of course I would not consent to that Taking the whole of this Vote I may say at once that I have no objection to the necessary expenditure upon the Lord Lieutenant house and the Chief Secretary residence in the Park In fact the very presence of the Lord Lieutenant and the Chief Secretary in Ireland be one of the reason in favour of the great question in which we be engage While no doubt a certain amount of expenditure be necessary if you look at the figure you will be somewhat astonished Dublin Castle the residence of the Lord Lieutenant and the Chief Secretary house be already build they be not in the course of erection yet the amount spend under the different heading on these building be I think it be almost absurd to suppose that these building require an annual expenditure of between and These contract give in Dublin by the Castle be to some extent in the nature of a bribe These contract be be give to Dublin tradesman and contractor and they want not to disappoint them they want to keep up the good feeling which be suppose to exist between a small class in Dublin and the Castle Therefore these contract be not cut down they be not In no other way could you explain the fact of between and be spend on these building JACKSON I think the Member be wrong about the amount I be take the Dublin Castle residence and the Under Secretary residence I be take the batch I find for furniture fitting and utensils the amount of spend annually Surely everyone must feel that that be no more than an extravagance it really amount to a fraud upon the taxpayer of this country The two residence be really only occupy a part of the time because the Lord Lieutenant who be a sporting character do not miss certain opportunity give him in this country for enjoy sport The Chief Secretary be here nearly the whole year round His visit to Ireland be so few and far between that he be practically only a short time there In the two residence and in that of the Under Secretary we have a year spend on fuel alone make a total amount for this set of residence of We have draw attention to this matter year after year and of course we get the same answer year after year I feel that if the Secretary to the Treasury could have exercise the same control in Dublin which he have exercise in this country this amount would have be cut down certainly to half what it be now I would like to know who it be that vouches for the accuracy and for the honesty of these figure because it be quite clear that such an amount a this could not fairly be spend The right Gentleman Sir Beach who be in Ireland will not I think gainsay what I have put forward in my argument that this expenditure be not a fair one I think we ought not to ask the taxpayer of this country to bear it unless solid reason for it can be give by the Secretary to the Treasury BEACH Bristol As I have have some experience of these house and live in one of them or year I will trouble the Committee with a few word on the subject feeling a I do in a perfectly independent position because I know nothing of the detail of this Vote But this I can tell the Committee that there be reason for a very considerable expenditure The Lord Lieutenant be a very large house the Chief Secretary be a good size one both be old and both need constant repair The Under Secretary house be of very fair size Then there be the Castle the Under Secretary lodge the Under Secretary house in Dublin and the Private Secretary lodge altogether residence include in this Vote To the Viceregal lodge and the Chief Secretary lodge very large and expensive garden be attach There be an enormous range of hothouse infinitely large than there be any real necessity for But at the same time they exist and when these thing exist it be very difficult to abolish them and the cost of maintenance be very great Of course on the other hand the Board of Works make a profit by sell the produce of the garden the Lord Lieutenant or the Chief Secretary purchasing such of the produce a they require That arrangement be first make when the right Gentleman opposite be Chief Secretary I can only say that know the circumstance of the case a I do there be need for a very large expenditure and I believe that there be no extravagance on the part of the Board of Works because it be necessary on account of the size of the building Barrow As I under stand the money have to be lay out because the building be somewhat dilapidated But if you take the money spend on the Viceregal lodge and garden you have nearly which be the interest on of capital It would be very much good to erect a new building if that be necessary at a cost of than to have this heavy annual expenditure With regard to the greenhouse and hothouse of which we have hear I think there would be no difficulty in do away with them and thus save the gardener wage and other expense Nothing could prove more clearly how desirable it be to grant Home Rule to Ireland than the observation which have fall from the President of the Board of Trade He fairly state to the House what he know What do he know He say himself I know nothing of the detail HICKS BEACH The Member have misunderstand me I say I know nothing of the detail of the Vote but I do know something of the circumstance of the building It do seem a haphazard a happy haphazard circumstance to have the right Gentleman here and I shall ask him some question I do not say it in any carping spirit but I be sure the Secretary to the Treasury know nothing about this matter In fact the business be not in his hand it be in the hand of some official in Ireland Therefore my remark hold good a regard Home Rule although it happen that the right Gentleman do not agree with me in that view The right Gentleman refer to the large size of these residence What do I find I find for the maintenance and supply and furniture and fitting of the poor Under Secretary house the sum of whereas the Chief Secretary lodge be and for precisely the same item As my Friend behind me say it be that this expenditure be thoroughly corrupt it be incur for the benefit of the Castle it be the patronage of the Castle Occasionally we have see Courtney eminent Gentlemen who do not agree with u on this side of the House go over to Ireland and come back and boast that they have be receive and by the tradesman of Ireland Why they do all that because of this expenditure This be the sort of bribe that be give to certain tradesman who be parade a the wisdom and the commerce and the wealth An MEMBER And the culture and the culture of the country and they grow well under it What a hothouse business be this The President of the Board of Trade tell u that there be an enormous number of hothouse and they require a large number of gardener and so forth Where do the produce go to The Chief Secretary for Ireland be very seldom in Ireland so that it be doubly absurd that we should be call upon to spend thousand of pound per annum in order to provide him with fruit out of certain hothouse in Dublin I think the House will be convince not so much by the reason which I have give a by the reason which the President of the Board of Trade have give that it be most desirable that a lesson should be teach to these Gentlemen and in reduce the Vote by the amount I propose I be perfectly certain no one in this world will suffer except some hungry greedy Unionist tradesman in Ireland The account be for new furniture and this year the amount be Furniture be not a thing which break down every year nor be that which be place in these residence of other than a solid character It be not make to look well for a year and then go to piece I put it seriously to the Secretary to the Treasury whether this sum of for furniture be not in itself absurd JACKSON I be afraid I can not give very information a to the detail but I do not admit the statement of the Member for Northampton that I know nothing about the matter Is it necessary JACKSON I go through the whole of the item of this expenditure and although the amount may seem to be considerable it do include a great deal besides what be ordinarily call furniture It include the repair of the fixture in all these building which contain a great number of apartment and the whole of the internal repair be provide under what be call furniture and fitting Well then there be the repair and renewal of carpet and matting JACKSON I mean such repair and renewal a may be necessary Then there be the question of gas fitting They last for year JACKSON I do not know whether the Member look at his own bill for gas fitting but if he do I think he will find that they do not last for year Then there be all the curtain and cabinet relic of various kind everything connect with a house of that description and blanket and bedding and glass and china and washing and all those item which come under the head of furniture and fitting I have go very carefully over the item of expenditure in previous year and I would point out that the Estimates compare favourably with those of former year because there be a decrease of upon the item of the Dublin Castle residence and there be a decrease upon the Under Secretary house there be a decrease upon the Viceregal lodge and garden there be a slight increase upon the Private Secretary lodge and a considerable increase for some special item connect with the Chief Secretary lodge in the shape of repair there be also an increase on the Under Secretary lodge I can assure the Committee the item be most carefully investigate I have an opportunity when I be in Dublin of go through them with the Board of Works in addition to which I have have them most carefully examine at the Treasury and I believe it be the very bad of economy to keep house at all and not to maintain them in proper repair because the inevitable result be that you have instead of an annual outlay a very large expenditure which come all in one year Of course it be not my business that be a question settle before but if you be to have these residence for these Ministers and officer then I believe it be really the best economy to maintain them in a condition of efficient external and internal repair A great portion of this expenditure have be on garden and I do not know how much be expend on gardener employ in the Viceregal garden JACKSON The salary do not come under this Vote Edinburgh I admit the soundness of the general view take by the Secretary to the Treasury but I do not think he quite appreciate the amount ask For these Departments in Dublin an expenditure of be demand and this be an increase upon the previous year CLANCY Dublin County It be interest to find a Liberal Unionist object to any part of the policy of the Government The Member draw the line at hothouses No wonder see that the Liberal Unionists have a very considerable hothouse in Birmingham just now I certainly agree with the Secretary to the Treasury that if these house be to be retain they ought to be maintain in a proper and respectable manner but they ought to be maintain by the gentleman who use them out of their own pocket The Chief Secretary get a year and if that be not enough for a single man he be difficult to satisfy The Chief Secretary have not only a large salary but he get a large allowance for coal I do not know what he want with this house at all He have no wife and family he have no domestic establishment he want no home I have a record of the right Gentleman appearance in Dublin When he become Chief Secretary on the March he come to Ireland to be formally admit to his office he then immediately return to England He come again on the July and he stay one day He come again on the of August and stay two day on the September and stay four day on the October and stay just about a fortnight and the December and stay day on Friday August and stay eight day on Saturday October and stay a week that be to say he be in Ireland three month out of a total of month An MEMBER day I make out three month though I may be overstate the I want to know what the Chief Secretary want with this house If I be correctly inform he do not spend these three month or day at the Lodge he stay a I understand at the Castle His visit be occasional like an angel though he do not appear very like an angel If this place be good enough on these rare and casual visit I do not see why the Castle apartment should not be suitable for him always If he be do any good in Ireland like other official not connect with the Castle I could understand the necessity for provide him with a residence there I be not go into any question of policy I merely want to show that the Chief Secretary could have execute his business just as well in England a by go over to Dublin On the first occasion it be necessary that he should go to sign proclamation under the Coercion Act I believe it be not legal to sign such in London but his second visit be avowedly for the purpose of authorize the prosecution of the Member for North East Cork and to make inquiry preliminary to the proclamation of the National League but there be no necessity to visit Dublin for the purpose This business could have be transact from the office in London and the right Gentleman habitually make inquiry from London on matter far more important than the proclamation of the League The third visit be in consequence of the massacre and the subsequent arrest of On that occasion certainly the right Gentleman must have regret his visit for it be then just a he be come away that he be serve with a writ at the suit of the Galway midwife whom he have libel in this House and in reference to which action he with characteristic courage plead privilege The next visit be to order the imprisonment of Blunt and whose subsequent prison treatment cause the prisoner death But there be no need to use the Lodge on this occasion he could have give his order from London and indeed he have habitually give such order There be no need for him to make the personal acquaintance of official in Dublin whom he habitually mist whose word he take implicitly on more important matter and the Lodge be not need on this occasion His last visit be to urge a more rigorous use of the Coercion Act and it have be observe more than once that when the application of the Coercion Act have somewhat languish the moment the right Gentleman appear in Dublin there be a of official brutality and persecution recommence wholesale against innocent and guilty alike I quite agree with the Secretary to the Treasury that if the house be to be maintain at all it must be in a decent and respectable manner but I say in the first place that there be no need to maintain it at all and next that the Chief Secretary be provide with a salary sufficient to enable him to maintain it out of his own pocket if the discharge of his duty require his presence in Ireland KENNY Tyrone Mid There be several item under this Vote that invite investigation and on which I be sure the Secretary to the Treasury will give u some information First I notice that the renewal of the roof of the Royal Hospital at be to cost of which be set down in the Estimates for the ensue year On this I would remark that it seem an extravagant sum for the repair of the roof of the din hall In the second place I note that the Government have make no provision at all for the conversion of the Royal Barracks at Dublin although there be an item of in relation to another barrack Of course I be preclude from enter into the subject a no Vote be down for the Royal Barracks but in passing I would say that be a disgraceful thing to allow a state of thing to continue by which soldier be die by score and not to attempt a remedy Then I observe an item in connection with the Albert Model Farm at There be two sum to be vote towards this establishment one of for new work in connection with the water supply and another vote bring up the whole to about Now we have each year a in regard to the farm showing profit and loss and this give rise to an impression that there be a considerable profit make or a considerable contribution make towards the maintenance of this establishment But be not this a little misleading in view of the fact that here be a sum of ask for for maintenance and extension of building There be besides two other point in connection with the Vote first for the work on the Clare slob land I notice some time ago an advertisement in a Belfast paper that there be this land for sale and I should like to know if the Gentleman can give me any idea of the total amount of money that have be expend on those land they consist of about acre I think and what amount the Board of Works be prepare to accept for the land now Another important item in the Vote in view of contingent proposal by the Government for the extension of light railway in Ireland be the Vote for a a contribution towards these undertaking The most expensive one be the Cavan Leitrim and Roscommon with a guarantee of per cent and invest a a contribution from local rate I would like to understand if there be any probability near or remote of these undertaking be able to pay their way I be sure it would greatly facilitate the progress of legislation if the Gentleman could assure u that there be some probability of these light railway line be in such a position that the Treasury would be relieve of further contribution towards their maintenance These be the principal item I wish to refer to but there be one other I would mention ask for in connection with building for the Royal University Now the principal portion of these building consists of a laboratory for the examination of medical student some four or five time in the course of the year For this purpose the expense be about a year Now there be a vote for the College of Science and in this there be a much good laboratory and all facility for the examination of student in chemistry and other branch If the Royal University Senate in conjunction with the Government have a little more sense and a desire for economy a year might be save by hold these examination at the College of Science and I recommend this for their consideration It appear to me that an expenditure of for simply examine a few student annually which examination could be conduct as well or good at the College of Science be a gross waste of money There would be this double advantage in accept my suggestion that the College of Science a institution would become good know The professor would be encourage their lecture would be attend and fee which be now in many case prohibitive would be avoid SHAW Bradford Central Before the Secretary to the Treasury answer I should like to ask him for some explanation a to the Vote for the charge make in respect to payment for the expense of the residence of the Chief Secretary I understand the Vote be increase by about this year the total amount for house and ground be We have always understand that it have be a complaint of successive Chief Secretaries that they be compel to pay charge for maintain the ground attach to the lodge of something like or a year Has any part of this charge be transfer to the public Exchequer or have the increase reference to some other payment Without enter into the question of the length of time the Chief Secretary occupy the lodge one can not but observe that the expense of the garden be very large and if a Chief Secretary be not able to spend a long time in Dublin it do not seem worth while to maintain hothouse and expensive range and so on to such an extent JACKSON I will answer the last question first I be afraid I can not quite remember the particular but as far a my recollection go the charge that be make be in this direction It use to be the practice that when one Chief Secretary succeed another the incoming Chief Secretary take over at a valuation a certain portion of the outside garden implement and property and this usually involve an expenditure of from to sometimes more and sometimes less This be felt to be a very inconvenient system and it be decide that the garden plant and so on which have be keep up at very considerable expense be keep up beyond what be necessary So it be arrange that the Government should take over the charge of the garden and that all unnecessary plant should be dispose of and that the expense should be very much cut down Of course the amount realize by sale go towards meet the expense As to the roof the Member be quite right the estimate total cost be half of which be expect to be expend in the come year The question be very carefully consider and it be prove conclusively I think that the condition of the roof be become a source of great danger and repair will have to proceed a opportunity offer The amount ask for this year be not more than will be necessary for the work The Member mention the Royal Barracks but a he say there be no Vote ask for on this account and it be a question for the War Office not the Board of Works to deal with In reference to the Albert Model farm I confess my own impression be very much that present by the Member The statement of account present every year do not appear to me to convey not a real debtor and creditor account of expenditure and income I make a good deal of inquiry in reference to the expenditure and I have the account investigate and come to the conclusion that the cost be extremely high At the same time I be tell that the institution have do a very great deal of good that although the number of student be small the instruction give be very valuable the teacher be very talented and the only regret be that the number of student be so small I be assure that the work be so valuable that it be quite impossible to entertain the idea of cut down the expenditure Although it be considerable we must continue to maintain it in the hope that the instruction give to the student will become a benefit to the country generally and that the number of student will increase Then I be ask about the Clare slob land The Member say he saw an advertisement ask for tender and he ask me what have be the total expenditure The Member be probably well acquaint with the district and the reclamation work carry on there I visit the place myself in the autumn of last year and spend some time in company with those able to explain to me the work that have be do be certainly an enormous work It have be more or less unfortunate in it history and the hope entertain in earlier day of the cost of reclamation have not be realize but we may hope that we have now get to the end of the expenditure upon the bank which have be build We hope we may consider it just about complete though the cost have be more than and I be not at all sanguine that that amount will be realize by the sale of land Hear hear JACKSON I know the Member for Cavan take a great interest in this subject but I beg him to remember that the decision to build this bank for the reclamation of these land be settle year ago and be one for which the Government be in no way responsible I be only glad to think that the enormous expenditure which have be go on for many year and which certainly for the last few year have be an expenditure very grudgingly agree to by the Government be now come to an end It be only fair that I should say that although I have see during my life a good many crop more or less prolific I be bound to say that be there when the harvest be just over and when the oat be on the ground on adjoin land reclaim land and practically I suppose the same character of land a that which have subsequently be reclaim I have no hesitation in say that in the whole course of my experience I never saw so heavy a crop upon any land a I do upon that occasion There can be no doubt that it be very valuable land The Member ask me what I expect to realize but I think he will see that inasmuch a I be in the position of the seller I would rather keep that information to myself and endeavour to find out how much I can get for it Another question have relation to light railway Well I be afraid the charge which be on the Estimates for this year be perhaps only the beginning of what may prove to be a far large charge in the future but Parliament have deliberately adopt this principle and therefore so far a the Treasury be concern we be bind to act in accordance with the Act of Parliament The Member ask me whether I think any of the line be likely to pay I do not quite know what he mean but it will be satisfactory to know that more than one of the Companies guarantee stock stand at a considerable premium in the market and that at all event seem to indicate that the security be a good one Although I do not wish to take too sanguine a view I do believe that light railway will prove a great advantage to the district through which they run and so far a I can judge there be distinctly a tendency to improve and I believe that at least three of these line of railway will before a very considerable lapse of time be find much near a position of pay than they be at the present time Then I be ask a question about the Royal University That be a subject upon which the Member know a great deal more than I do but I have make a note of his suggestion and I will cause inquiry to be make Question put and negative Original Question put and agree to to complete the sum for Science and Art Building Dublin SEXTON May I ask if this be to be a final vote Expenditure have now be proceed for ten year May we suppose that it will conclude in the come financial year JACKSON I have every hope and every expectation that the work connect with the building will be complete in the financial year In fact I be assure that the building will be ready for open in August but I should not like to say that I entirely accept that statement but judge from what I saw when I be in Dublin last and the representation that have be sub make to u I have every reason to believe that the work will be finish this year Question put and agree to Resolutions to be report Committee to sit again"
99461	"SUPPLY   MISCELLANEOUS ESTIMATES.]_1831"	"Spring Rice move the Order of the Day for the House to resolve itself into a Committee of Supply Hume take that opportunity of complaining of the appointment of a Committee it have be appoint at a late hour that morning on the Militia Estimates without any previous notice have be give This be against the usual practice of the House for without such notice it be impossible that Members could be prepare to meet discussion Sir say that the Committee be a matter of form The Committee be only to examine the Estimates a they might be propose to them Spring Rice say that it would be in the recollection of the Members of the last Parliament that two vote be move and carry in the Committee of the last Session He would put these into the hand of the Chairman in the first instance Hume say he should have be glad to have see the noble Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in his place in order to hear from him what be the specific reduction which he have make pursuant to his promise and assurance before the recess in the Diplomatic and Consular department By this plan of the noble Lord it would seem a if the country would be benefit to the extent of nearly As to the system of the North American States it be far preferable and much cheap than ours the Consuls be take from the resident merchant of that nation in the different maritime port of Europe and elsewhere Spring Rice say he have postpone for the purpose of afford the noble Lord an opportunity to explain them more explicitly these very Estimates relative to our Consuls abroad Hume be glad of it for the cry of every one be that this department should be reform Spring Rice say he would now move the Miscellaneous Estimates under the head No and on this part he have but few observation to make The alteration in the Civil List make it difficult to make any comparison between the vote of this year and the last As some of the item have not come before Parliament hitherto he could only take an Estimate of the average expense for the last three year Under some head it would appear that an increase have take place whereas in fact there have be a decrease This be owe to the transfer of several head of expenditure from the Civil List to the present Estimates Thus for instance under the head of public building there would appear an increase of whereas in fact there be a decrease of The cause of the difference be the introduction of the sum for repair of palace which be formerly place in the Civil List As they be not acquaint with this expenditure which have not be bring under the notice of Parliament before the only Estimate they could make be a he have say by take an average of the three precede year He have now to move that a sum not exceed be grant for defray the expense of public work and repair of public building hop that a the country have go to some expense in the acquisition of some very valuable painting of the best master and have be assist in the formation of that collection call the National Gallery by the munificence of several private person who be great patron of Art the Government would not adopt the mistaken economy of allow them to remain at great hazard in a house which must come down by article of agreement shortly and the security of which be already endanger by the improvement carry on in the rear of the house in That property be estimate at above the value of Spring Rice say that no intimation of the house be in a state of danger have reach the Treasury But if apprehension be entertain he would take care that property so valuable should be remove to a place of great safety Hume say the print Estimates before the House be such a could afford no adequate information to a person desirous of know what in reality they be or to what object the total be applicable in detail This be in violation of a promise give to the House by the noble Lord the Chancellor of the Exchequer He have understand that all vote for sum not strictly for the use of his Majesty should come before that House for it consideration and decision be an amount of nearly yearly Many of the item of expenditure comprise in these Estimates he consider highly objectionable Amongst other item there be one for Windsor Castle and the repair of other palace amount to Now he would ask be such a large expenditure necessary in addition to the enormous expense already incur on these building Lord say he should have no objection to make a more detailed and specific statement if the Committee think it necessary The Board of Works however be a Board which attend minutely to it duty and it be responsible for the application of these sum require for the repair of those public and national building observe the vote have only reference to the ordinary work and repair under the control of that Board Spring Rice say his friend be confound the public work and the repair of palace which be quite different Robert Gordon could not see how should be require for ordinary repair of palace independent of the improvement of Spring Rice say the Estimate be make on the average of the last three year it be only an estimate If any surplus remain it would go of course to the credit of the next year When his friend express surprise at the amount of the vote he should recollect that it include the ordinary repair of ten palace Colonel could not see why so large a sum should be require for repair at He do not know for what this expense be except for an whom we do not want there He would say we do not want these person amongst u They have no business here He should not be surprised if we should also be call on to pay the of the Duke of at the Clarendon Hotel We do not want these person a a to u and we ought not to encourage them a it be probable we might have some more of the same description come amongst u Spring Rice say the Gentleman might make his mind easy a to the subject of expense on these ground The country have be put to no expense by the individual to whom he allude As to his unfortunate anticipation he would say nothing but he have always understand that it be the pride of England that her shore be open a an asylum to the unfortunate of all country and he hop that asylum would never be close against expatriate gentleman because they be of a high rank and could ill brook hardship As to the expense of the Gentleman might make himself easy none of it be incur for the party to whom he refer John Martin say a they be on the subject of public work he could not but call the attention of Government to the present state of Westminster Hall He suppose that be include in the public building and he could not see why it should be leave in it present disgraceful state It be one of the fine Halls in Europe and yet for year it have be leave in a state at which any foreigner who visit it be astonish It have for a long time be make a sort of lumber store for the record of the Courts of Law and now when those be partly remove he saw no attempt make to repair it In fact it be now in the same state in which it be leave at the removal of the two Courts at the upper end of the Hall Surely it be unworthy of a country like this which make so large an outlay upon public building that this admirable structure should be allow to go thus to ruin He do hope that Government would pay attention to this subject Ferguson concur what have fall from the Member a to the state of Westminster Hall One of the fine Halls in Europe be a disgrace to the country in the eye of a stranger say that half the record have now be remove from the Hall He suppose the other part would be remove for no improvement could take place till the whole be take away Lord say that it be the of Government to put the Hall into proper repair Part of the record be already remove and the others would soon be take away The Master of the Rolls with his usual liberality have offer his house in for the reception of the record until some proper place should be provide for them Hume do not think the remark of the member for Gordon have be answer It be say that we have ten palace to repair what do we want them for If we do not use them for public purpose why not pull them down or dispose of them and save the public any farther expense about them They be now and he would mention Palace a an instance a kind of barrack for the accommodation of titled pauper He repeat they be a kind of workhouse keep up at the public expense for the reception of that class of pauper whose friend ought to support them if they could not support themselves At all event the public ought not to be saddle with the of keep them in palace Gentlemen might cry Oh but what he say be the truth though it might be very disagreeable to some of those who hear him He do not want to make any comparison between the republican form of government and that under which we live but he could not shut his eye to the fact that the whole civil government of Washington do not amount to as much a we pay for these palace which be of no other use but to receive titled pauper He could call them nothing else the poor pauper do not pay for his lodging in the workhouse and these high pauper be keep in lodging at the public expense But see how this operate This expense be pay by tax and how be they raise Look at the number of distress issue to collect them bed be take from poor family to raise the assessed tax family many of whom be only just raise above the poor rate themselves But the get rid of the expense of keep up useless palace would render this amount of individual suffering unnecessary This be the true way to look at the question yet when this plain truth be tell Gentlemen cry out Oh oh oh He have see in one of the public paper that his Majesty have state that he want only two house a and a Why then should all these palace be keep up Depend on it the country could not go on while such extravagant expenditure be continue Rice say they alter the Civil List that all such vote a this might be exclude from it say mention have be make of America but no comparison could be fairly draw between the two country a to expenditure on this head At the same time he think we should expend no more than be absolutely necessary and that a time should be fix when the grant for these building should cease Lord say that this be the first year in which these vote separate from the Civil List have be debate and he think that the discussion which have take place upon them that night prove the benefit of have extract them from the Civil List Hume express his regret that the building have not be complete at once instead of be starve a they be now by spread the grant over two or three year and leave the property of the Museum unprotected He be sure the public desire to see the work complete and he hop they would be so complete in the next year Hume object to the expense of keep two or three engineer in constant employment when one would be sufficient Dawson agree with the Member in condemn this expense and observe that during the time he be connect with the Treasury he have the pleasure of reduce the expense connect with the by many thousand pound Sir Henry defend the conduct of the Commissioners and the economy of their expenditure Public work such a the Men Bridge and the Harbour require the constant attention of an engineer At where a pier be erect in the open sea unless an engineer be present to direct repair after a storm the whole work might be destroy and he be sure no one grudge a year for take care of the He be prepare to prove that the Commissioners for the had save the country upwards of a year and he court inquiry bore testimony to the meritorious exertion of the right Baronet and the Commissioners He have at all time think the improvement of the communication between England and Ireland a matter of great importance and differ from his right friend Dawson on the propriety of lower the expenditure Not see any vote for the purpose of improve the at Milford Haven he wish to ask if that object have be abandon Spring Rice say that no vote have be propose for that purpose because there be at present money enough in hand to carry it on Spring Rice say that a the next grant to be propose involve a question of principle he beg leave to trouble the House with a few observation upon it In complaint have be make of the inadequacy of the at Liverpool a person be send down to inspect them who report that it be essential to the public interest that there should be new building and that the old one should be enlarge An agreement be in consequence make between the Treasury and the Corporation of Liverpool that the former should expend on that object provide the Corporation would contribute more and enter into a guarantee that they would defray any excess over the amount of the Estimate or The mode in which this sum of be to be pay by the Treasury be highly objectionable for it be propose that it should come out of the proceeds of the revenue department in their way to the Exchequer He have therefore be instruct by his noble friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer to communicate to the corporation of Liverpool that although his Majesty present Government felt no difficulty in carry into effect the agreement in question yet that they could not consent to do so unless by a vote in Parliament Feeling therefore that that be the most satisfactory and constitutional mode of proceed he should move a a Resolution to grant to his Majesty the sum of be one year expenditure for the of the in Liverpool Robert Gordon entirely agree in opinion with his friend and think the principle which he have lay down an excellent one It would form an admirable precedent for any future Ministry which might hereafter enter into engagement for the erection of public building There have be several case in which large sum among the rest for the new have be improperly pay out of the revenue instead of have be submit a vote to Parliament observe with reference to the agreement that have be make with the Corporation of Liverpool that although he have no personal concern with it yet be satisfy of it propriety he have no objection to stand forth a the vindicator of those who have enter into the agreement in with the Corporation of Liverpool If it come to a question however who ought to defend the transaction certainly the right Gentlemen opposite should do so some of whom be then in office The point complain of be the manner in which the expense of the building be to be defray now he be not aware that any arrangement have be make that would prevent the matter from be bring before the House and therefore he could not think there be any thing improper in the transaction a his friend seem to suppose Hume wish to know when the building be begin Spring Rice say he believe last year or the year before at all event nearly have already be expend on the work Hume strongly condemn the mode in which it have be intend to carry the agreement into effect without in the first place submit it for the approbation of that House He look forward to Parliamentary Reform a calculate to give a check to such practice If any Government should after that presume to undertake such work without the consent of Parliament it would certainly receive such a lesson a would teach others to be more cautious for the future In his opinion it be a great dereliction of duty to commence expensive work without first obtain the consent of Parliament Here collect some year ago a question be put a to what part the public be to bear in the erection of these building and he have a clear impression on his mind that the answer give be that the whole expense be to be bear by the Corporation It be a great and important question whether any Minister be authorise to involve the country in such expense He think the excuse offer by the right Gentleman be no excuse at all It be immaterial whether the right Gentleman be the originator of the measure or not it be his duty on come into office immediately after the work have be begin a he do to bring the matter under the consideration of Parliament before any expense be incur Lord believe the right Gentleman could not be make responsible on the present occasion because he be not the Minister who originally propose the expense but he entirely agree with his friend that the practice of enter into these kind of engagement ought to be discontinue It be impossible that the House could have a clue control over the public money without be a party to the original contract In the present instance the House be place in this situation if they disapprove of the arrangement make by the Treasury it would be impossible to depart from it without give the Corporation of Liverpool ground for complain that the Government have be guilty of a breach of faith say that no other course could have be pursue than that which have be adopt in the present instance And he apprehend it be usual when Government contemplate any such improvement a the one in question to take upon itself the responsibility of make the previous arrangement Could the Government come down to the Mouse of Commons and ask it opinion a to whether it should enter into an agreement with the corporation of Liverpool It be usual for the Treasury to enter into arrangement with party on the understanding that it depend on the House of Commons to grant or refuse the sum which be necessary to carry those arrangement into effect With respect to this particular transaction if he recollect rightly a question be ask in the House relative to the term of the bargain make with the Corporation of Liverpool and the answer give be shortly what now appear in detail on the face of the Estimates say that the proper time to call upon the House to ratify or reject an arrangement of this description be before a stone of the building be lay The servant of the Crown undoubtedly make contract upon their own responsibility but then before a shilling be lay out the assent of Parliament ought to be obtain If the House should now reject the arrangement would not the Corporation of Liverpool have a right to complain that they have be induce to expend several thousand pound on false pretence say that the Corporation of Liverpool do not hesitate to become party to the arrangement because they think it be so reasonable that Parliament would acquiesce in it He do not know any other way in which a question of this kind could have be bring under the consideration of the House Spring Rice admit that Parliament could not assume the executive power but it ought in his opinion to have complete control over the public money The Treasury Minute of the arrangement contain nothing which make the arrangement contingent on the sanction of Parliament On the contrary the notion of parliamentary control appear to be completely abandon by the Minute He admit that a question have be ask in the House on the subject some time ago but that be not the way to obtain the assent of the Commons of England to an undertaking which involve the expenditure of He think it be not sufficient to warrant any Government to enter into a contract on the faith of which individual be induce to give up their land and expend their money that it suppose merely the assent of the Commons might be obtain Ministers might not always command majority in that House say he do not deny that the House of Commons should have complete and absolute control over the public expenditure but if the right Gentleman opposite be anxious to read a lecture on the subject he beg that he would read it to Lord who be the author of the arrangement when Chancellor of the Exchequer in He do not mention the circumstance from any feeling of hostility to the noble Lord who he be sure have no idea of supersede the just authority of Parliament All engagements with the Treasury be make on the standing that if the House would not grant the necessary fund the engagement be to be at an end In ordinary oasis party advance their money know the decision of Parliament be not yet obtain The only occasion on which the House could express it opinion with respect to the propriety of public work be when they be call upon to vote money for carry them into execution If the observation of the Gentleman imply a censure on any one it be not on him but on the noble Lord to whom he have allude Robert Gordon say his right friend who have just sit down have state the case too generally It be a mere mockery to say that the House could fairly express it opinion with respect to any arrangement after it have be partly carry into execution a in the present case It be then impossible for the House to withhold it assent Now what be the term of the agreement in this instance No reservation whatever respect the control of Parliament be make in the Treasury Minute which be in the following term In consideration of the Corporation of Liverpool advance this Board undertake to pay the sum of There be not the slight reference to Parliament He confess the speech of his friend Spring Rice from that side of the House be to him most satisfactory for have he not actually see him he should have imagine he be still on the other side of the House from whence he have so often hear him with delight and where for fourteen or fifteen year he have the pleasure of act with him say that the work be begin in and all the Estimates connect with them be lay before the Finance Committee He cordially approve of the sentiment express by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Gentleman who sit near him and if he think any attempt could be make to remove this grant from the control of Parliament he a a member for Liverpool would not forget his duty a a Member of that House be one of those who sincerely hop and trust that a new line of conduct be about to be pursue by the Ministry in reference to the expenditure of the public money and he be quite sure the public would receive with great pleasure the statement make by the noble Lord and the Secretary to the Treasury He hail the manner in which the vote have be propose a an additional pledge on the part of the Ministry and a an additional proof that they mean to keep the promise they have make previous to their accession to office and also a a proof that they be determine to restore to the House that constitutional control over the national expenditure which it ought to possess Hume express a wish that in future the Estimate should contain some detail respect the distribution of this sum It be a complete specimen of the manner of make up account so a to prevent their be understood Sir participate in the desire entertain by the member for Middlesex Lord say that hereafter the vote should be accompany with as much detail a possible complain of the confused manner in which the Estimates be draw up generally He have take some pain to understand them but he find it impossible to make any thing of them Hume refer to the expense of the examination on the East Bill expense which he think very great but which he do not grudge under the circumstance a he think that the conduct of the Government on that subject have produce the present Reform Bill He wish to know how much of the sum be actually expend for the witness Spring Rice answer about Colonel thought if that be the case that those who bring the matter forward ought to be content to pay the expense out of their own pocket George Robinson ask if the recommendation of the Committee the management of the Colonies have be attend to and whether any arrangement be in progress for reduce their expense Lord say there could be no doubt that some abuse exist in the colonial system Many of the colony be tax high than they ought to be but it be felt that it would be harsh and unjust suddenly to attempt to reduce the emolument of those who have give up their pursuit and profession in this country for the purpose of go to distant and unhealthy climates The late report make by the Colonial Commissioners do not point out any immediate reduction that could be make It simply recommend certain reduction without assign any reason therefore it could not be act upon by those who be responsible for the state of these account The report of the Committee give no clue to the manner in which it recommendation be to be act upon though it be the earnest desire of the noble Lord at the head of the Colonial Department to carry the recommendation of the Committee into effect As a proof of this he might mention that in fill up a lately vacant Government the noble Lord have effect a reduction of in a salary of George Robinson understand that the Committee have be appoint to investigate the whole of the Colonial establishment which ought to undergo a thorough revision His Majesty Ministers he think could find no fairer field to carry their plan of retrenchment and economy into effect He hop therefore that the noble Lord at the head of the Colonial Department would make every possible reduction Hume would undertake to say no reduction would be make until the Colonies be allow to tax themselves He be satisfy the noble Lord be quite sincere but no effectual improvement could take place until the purse of England be close to the Colonies and they be teach to depend on their own resource Look at Newfoundland if instead of govern it from Downing Street it have a Legislative Assembly and be allow to tax itself it would be no expense and we should not have to provide Governors and other establishment He beg to inquire what have be do respect the office of Governor of Gibraltar Lord answer that Lord the Governor be still alive Hunt say that he wish to take that opportunity of call the attention of the House to a most formidable coalition of which the newspaper have lately make frequent mention He be accuse of have enter into a coalition but that coalition have cost the country nothing and never would cost the country a farthing The coalition he speak of however be very different at least if the newspaper be to be believe He wish to know whether their statement be true and therefore he bring the matter under the consideration of the House He wish to give the noble Lord opposite the opportunity of contradict the report which he hop and he might even say he believe to be untrue It be this that the noble Lord at the head of the Government have enter into a coalition with the member of his family whom he have place upon the country at an annual expense of He wish to know if this be true Lord rise and say that from what the Member have just utter he really think the Member could not understand the meaning of the word coalition He felt anxious to say one word upon the subject thus introduce He know that his noble friend have be attack in some newspaper for place his family in different situation If those person so place be unfit for the situation they occupy it be right to attack him But if they be not unfit for those situation then the attack ought not in justice to be make As to the statement about he could only say that it be an absurdity He would now declare his opinion of his noble friend that no man have ever be less actuate by motif of mere private interest His noble friend have always sacrifice his private interest to his public duty for if he have not do so every one must be aware that he need not have be absent from office nearly his whole life Lord felt grateful most grateful for the observation just make by the noble Lord but at the same time he could not but regret that the noble Lord should have notice such an attack proceed from such a quarter which ought only to be treat with silent and utter contempt Hunt hop that the public would hear of that answer regret to break in upon a discussion which have cause so much amusement and which have become so very animate The noble Lord opposite throw out some insinuation that the Committee do not fully state the reason on which it have found it recommendation But the fact be that the Committee have enter into a very arduous examination of document and have pursue it labour with the great desire to ascertain the course to be take The noble Lord must be aware that it be not possible for the head of a department to make reduction although he have the strong desire to do so Lord observe that all he have say be that no such reason for carry these reduction into effect be assign a to enable those who be responsible to act on the recommendation They be oblige to make the examination over again so that in fact the labour of the Committee have to be go through by the Secretary of State George Robinson hop the noble Lord at the head of the Department would proceed with the inquiry otherwise a the labour of the Committee have cease the House could not be make acquaint with the state of the Colonial account and it be most important that at least an abstract of them should be lay before the House Warburton believe it would be most beneficial if the House

aid by the Excise arrest six individual accuse of aid in the escape of the two men first apprehend He be inform but he trust the account be exaggerated that those six individual be take between one and two in the morning whilst in their bed and be carry to a place appropriate a the for the local residence of the soldiery That place be intend originally for a bank safe It contain an outer room with a bar window and an inner room with a window similarly defend One might have think that the military be in the outer room the prisoner might have be put in the inner room but it be state publicly and he have not see it contradict that the petty authority and he say petty authority because he mean to draw a distinction between them and the high authority not content with try to keep the prisoner in the inner room put them into the bank safe the dimension of which be nine foot eleven inch and a quarter in length three foot nine inch in breadth and six foot eleven inch in height build particularly for the exclusion of air and for the protection of the bank book from fire Such be the place into which the civil authority put six individual five men and a boy and he be tell that they confine them there from two in the morning until nine the same even seven hour with this exception that one individual be take so ill about an hour after his confinement that he absolutely vomit blood and the cry of the others draw the attention of those who have charge of the prisoner they open the door and take out that individual but they it on the rest who be keep there until nine in the morning when the lieutenant of the county who have act throughout all those unfortunate disturbance with great humanity and firmness for which all be ready to give him credit arrive at the spot and give the prisoner air He be far informed that of those individual who have so suffered one upon examination before a magistrate be immediately dismiss a entirely guiltless of all crime and that the other five be commit to prison to take their trial that they have be admit to bail but up to that moment in February this have happen early in October they be untried their innocence not prove nor

the fact be a he have represent them and if they be or if they bore even a semblance to them then whether he have take any measure to punish those who could be guilty of so great a crime for a crime he would term it under the cloak of the administration of justice put person merely take up and therefore bound to be hold innocent into such a place a that he have describe the horror of which he would answer for it be as bad a those of the of Calcutta He wish to know far whether any step have be take to bring those five individual who be at present on bail to trial so that they might have the opportunity of either make out their innocence or if guilty of make some atonement to the law they have transgress The have ascertain that five of the individual allude to by the right Gentleman be

sufficiently secure That be clone between three and four in the morning and the prisoner be liberate between eight and nine but the door be frequently open during the morning and when any of the prisoner want anything they call for it and whatever they require be give to then He state that upon the information of some of the prisoner themselves give in the course of the investigation They do not then complain of want of air or of the closeness of the cell It be not until some time towards the middle of January that any complaint have be make or that any information have reach him on the

16697	"CHURCH BUILDINGS ACT AMENDMENT BILL._1854"	"EARL NELSON rise to move an Amendment for the purpose of make the measure exceptional rather than general He desire by the Amendment to prevent the ill effect that must arise if there be a feeling abroad that no sooner be churchyard close than power be give though money might have be pay for the burial of the body in these churchyard to sell them and that that be to be a general power There be also a general power in the Bill for pull down church and his object be to induce their Lordships to confine it to the City of London and to other case if they could be find like the City of London and to put them in a schedule annexed to the Bill so that the Bill might not go forth to the country a a general rule but only a an exceptional one Another objection to the Bill be that have reference both to the country and to London there be no check in the Bill to limit the operation of it in regard to the amount of population It be advisable to introduce in Committee some limit a to the number of the population where a church must be keep and the number of the population where a new church should be build and this a the Bill at present stand it would be impossible to do because the rule that be applicable to London would not be applicable to the country It might be say and he so far agree that one of the great us of the Bill be the union of benefice propose by it he have propose an Amendment however to the very first clause touch the union of benefice on this principle that a special case could be show it be wrong that they should by a a it be alter an Act which be watch in the most jealous manner whenever a proposition be bring forward that an alteration should be make in it If a further amendment of the Union of Act be require throughout the country he have no objection to it so long a it be bring forward a an amendment of that measure and not bring forward by a He would remind their Lordships of the ground on which the present Bill be justify by the promoter of it In the first place it be say that the City of London be leave without a population altogether that the population have go to other place and the proposal therefore be to pull down their church and set them up in those other place And in the next place they say they want to sell the site because they would get so large a value for them a be situate in the City of London He Earl Nelson doubt himself whether even these reason would justify this Bill but he be quite certain and he trust their Lordships would agree with him that unless case could be show of a similar nature there be no reason which would justify them in allow a a general rule the pull down of church and the selling of the churchyard where these ground could not be show to exist With reference to place out of London the Bishop of Chichester who be on the Committee have a case which he be anxious the Bill should meet but the object be to join a large parish outside the town to a small parish That have only reference to the union of parish and have no reference to the pull down of church or the sale of churchyard in fact he particularly mention that he do not want to pull down the church The right rev Prelate the Bishop of Lincoln have state to him the case of Lincoln and he would put it to the House whether the case which be show to exist in Lincoln be a case which would justify the extravagant clause in this Bill It appear that in the city of Lincoln there be thirteen small church and the right rev Prelate consider that in consequence of the smallness of the endowment of those church it would be much good to unite many of them and in that he agree with him but that only refer to the uniting of benefice But the right rev Prelate also say that it would be also convenient to all these thirteen church of Lincoln for the purpose of build five large church in different part of the city Now however strong the case might be show in London to justify the questionable proceeding of pull down church and the site of the churchyard he doubt whether they should allow such a thing to take place on such comparatively small and insufficient ground a those put forward in respect to Lincoln He be tell there be another very great case in Norwich which would quite overwhelm them Knowing that Norwich be celebrate for it large number of church they think they have a case that be very likely to be a strong one to show that Norwich be similarly situate to the City of London He ask their Lordships to attend to a statement receive by him from a friend whose authority he could not doubt respect the City of Norwich from which it appear that a a general rule in that city where the clerical duty be even decently well perform the church with all their disadvantage of high pew and dilapidated building be upon the whole well attend His informant no doubt state that he have visit one church where there be only three person besides himself at the morning service but the reason of that be that the clergyman have some impediment in his speech which make it difficult to understand what he say and he question if those three person have ever attend before They would also find that the church of Julian about a quarter of a mile distant have fall down have be rebuild and his correspondent state that on his way to the service he saw a number of person sufficient to fill three such church smoke and read lead to the supposition that if curate be appoint in that parish the result would be satisfactory Judging therefore he add from his observation of the attendance at the church and of the inhabitant around the church he be convince that whenever the experiment be try of increase the number of work clergy in the parish the church accommodation in Norwich would not be equal to the population and that there would be sufficient congregation to fill every one of the church in every individual parish He would say therefore that none of the case which have come to his knowledge out of the City of London afford sufficient reason for this measure and he call upon their Lordships therefore to consider whether under these circumstance this Bill which be base upon the known state of many of the church in the City of London ought to be allow to operate all over the country merely at the will of the bishop check by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners The question of the sale of consecrated site be a very serious one and he call upon their Lordships by affirm the Amendment he now propose not to allow this Bill to go forth as generally applicable but if clear case could be show to justify it application then let those case be place with the City of London in the Schedule The noble Earl conclude by propose an Amendment leave out in the clause the word city or market town and limit the application of the Bill to the City of London THE EARL OF say the noble Earl seem to think that the bishop as soon a they get this Bill pass would set to work with sledgehammer and destroy church in all direction in the midst of our town excite everywhere the alarm and horror of the population Now so far from this be the case he believe that it would go against every natural feeling on the part of the right rev Bench to destroy church and make away with consecrate ground except an absolute necessity could be show That necessity in many case do exist and in a pressing form With regard to the statement make by his noble Friend he have to remind their Lordships that the party most interested be most anxious that the measure should pass Thus with regard to Norwich all he could say be that the Dean of Norwich who might be suppose to be pretty well acquaint with the want of that city be he believe anxious that the Bill should be generally apply In regard to York he understand the Archbishop be also anxious that the Bill should be extend throughout the kingdom so again be the Bishop of Chichester who be certainly no great iconoclast and it be the same with regard to several others of the cathedral city those person who be the most conversant with the want of the people there in regard to church accommodation be most anxious to be admit to a share of the benefit which they believe would be confer by this Bill Under these circumstance without go far into detail he trust that their Lordships would admit the principle of make the Bill generally applicable and would pass the clause a it stand THE BISHOP OF OXFORD say without at all share the extravagant fear entertain by some of the opponent of this Bill he confess that he think it would have be the safe course for the present to limit it operation to the City of London In the first place he think the House ought thoroughly to understand that in one point of fact this Bill introduce an entirely new principle It have be state that it only proceed upon a principle that have be long act upon in other case and that be adopt in the case of the building of London Bridge and the like but their Lordships would observe that the principle involve in this Bill be totally different from that In the case of London Bridge the Church have give all the sanctity it could confer on a certain space of ground that have be set apart for the service of God and the burial of the Christian dead and it be think necessary or expedient for the benefit of the public that the Church right in this respect should be overrule by the national authority and that the ground should be take back by the country for some great national or metropolitan object Now the principle of the present Bill be entirely a different one It be not intend to enable because no such measure be necessary the State to resume for it own purpose what have be grant for the use of the Church but to enable the Church which have become possess of certain site that by change of circumstance have become very valuable in point of price in case where the population have in the course of time migrate from the neighbourhood of a church to a great distance from one to sell those land in order that it might endow new church to be erect in the suburb or in district to which the population have betaken itself The new principle set up be this not that the State be to overrule so to speak the Church act but that the Church have declare the act it have do so far a it be concern to be perpetual be to be allow to terminate the perpetuity and to part for a money advantage with the land and building that it have consecrate Now whether it be right or wrong this be a principle which they ought to admit slowly and with caution Parliament should require a strong case to be make out before admit it anywhere and when admit they should require it not to be admit far than the case make out strictly demand Now it seem to him that if the principle they be now call upon to adopt be apply to London alone and it operation there be find to be unexceptionable and that the feeling of Christian men be not rudely nor unnecessarily violate by the removal of the sacred edifice they have be in the habit of frequent if they find that new church be build in the suburb and endow with the proceeds of the old site and that they be fill by a population that have before wander a case would be make out in favour of the principle and it would not be too much to ask the promoter of the general Bill to renew their application next year so that Parliament might extend the principle to other place in the country where circumstance call for it Therefore no hardship would be entail on those who might have to wait the necessary time until the experiment have be try in London and find in it working to be an unobjectionable one He confess that he admit the principle with very considerable reluctance and so do his right rev Friend who propose it but his right rev Friend have state that he felt himself overborne by the consideration of the necessity of those for whose benefit the measure be frame and that he regret the inevitable shock it must cause to the feeling of those who have be accustom to attach sacred association to these place to see them convert to different purpose He be sure the proposition be make with the purest and best intention and with a sincere desire to enable the Church to expand her truest energy for the spiritual of the people but the promoter of the measure must allow equal credit to a difference of upon the detailed application of this principle The right rev Prelate the Bishop of London who must be best acquaint with the want of the See he have so long administer be convince of the necessity of the measure against his will and therefore he the Bishop of Oxford ask their Lordships to limit the application of it principle for the present to that diocese in which it have be declare to be essential and then if it succeed there it might afterwards be extend to other part of the country There be considerable advantage in maintain a good number of church in populous city To take the case that have be already mention he should be sorry to see the thirteen church in one large provincial city pull down in order that by rule and compass they might have five large church build in their stead In the first place the religious sympathy and feeling of men could not be reason down upon such abstract rule and they might administer a serious shock to the feeling of those whose family have for generation perhaps be in the habit of worship in particular church Another thing to which they must not shut their eye be that there be considerable variation and he for one be not sorry to see those variation in the mode of perform the common service of the Church because such variation root itself in the different peculiarity and tendency of man nature one form be more adapt to the feeling of one man than it might be to those of another Add to this the result of prejudice and education and they would see that this diversity be exceedingly desirable and far good than rigidly tie down the whole worship population of a large town to one absolutely level plain in the mode of administer the common service of the Church of England We all know that the congregation of one church like more singing introduce into the service than be practise in another that one congregation would not be satisfy if this or that particular canticle be omit whilst another would hold it to be almost Romanist if some portion of the service be chant By have these multiplicity of church they give room for this legalised dissimilarity which suit the taste of different body of worshipper whereas if they pull down the church which people have be in the habit of attend and tell them they must go to a church henceforward that be to be conduct in a different form to what they have be accustom and be to throw in merely a a part and perhaps an infinitesimal part of a district those who might have be the lead men in small parish and have a very influential voice in determine the mode in which the service should be conduct they would be introduce a dangerous principle that might do great violence to the feeling of those who be worshipper in particular church in provincial town and city He ask the House then to weigh these thing before extend by a needless haste over the whole of the country a principle which he for one do not object to in the City of London It be say that the Bill provide such check that no harm could be do by it that the Archbishops and the Church Building Commissioners have a veto upon the application of it provision to a particular case But it must be remember that the power of the Church Commissioners would expire in two year accord to the measure before their Lordships so that one of those check would thereby be take away and then the only check leave would be that of the Primate Now only last night matter have be discuss in the presence of his Grace who then state his objection to the power of assent or dissent be leave in the hand of person in his position who would necessarily have to trust to the representation make from the particular locality and he say that Parliament have no right to throw upon them such a responsibility He the Bishop of Oxford could not see that any inconvenience would arise to all these city and town if they be call on to wait till the result of a year experience of the measure have be ascertain upon a confined area and therefore he think it would be most in accordance with the caution of their Lordships ordinary legislation to limit the operation of this principle to the City of London in the first instance THE BISHOP OF LONDON say with regard to the check impose by this Bill it be quite true that a the law now stand the power of the Church Building Commissioners would expire at no distant period but he venture to say that if the function of those Commissioners be put an end to another body with similar power must be constitute a the multifarious duty confide to the Commissioners be such a it would be impossible for them to fulfil within the limited time give in the Bill upon their Lordships table and they be engage in a great extent and variety of operation with regard to church building which must be to some body Although he have himself be a Church Building Commissioner for the last thirty year he say with great confidence that a good body than those Commissioners could not be with the same duty Thus the check afford by the veto give to these Commissioners if that body be do away with would have to be transfer to the body who take their place and would therefore still continue in existence With respect to the check to be give to the bishop of the diocese it be quite true also that it might not be expedient to leave the power altogether in the hand of one individual and it might perhaps be right to interpose the authority of the Secretary of State Some check however must be provide and he confess therefore that he do not see the force of the urge against the proposition on this head his right rev Friend the Bishop of Oxford in state his objection to the general application of the Bill have base one of those objection on the necessity of keep up a diversity in the manner of perform the Church service Now in his the Bishop of London opinion so far from it be desirable that there should be a different mode of perform the service in each of several church it be most desirable that there should be a great uniformity for he believe without recommend too rigid or strict a rule in this respect that great uniformity in the service of the different church would be calculate to give the Church a great hold upon the affection of the people It do not necessarily follow when the congregation of two church be united that in the church which be retain divine service would be perform in a different manner from that in which it have be celebrate in the church which be remove or that there would not at all event be a disposition on the part of the incumbent of the church to which a new congregation be transfer to meet their wish so far a he could do so consistently with his sense of duty He look therefore upon the argument ground upon the assumed necessity for this diversity a be untenable and therefore that there be no substantial reason for continue supernumerary church either in the metropolis or in some of the large city of the country As far a he be personally concerned he would be content that the measure should be confine to the City of London a originally intend but he have learn from several right rev Prelates that in their cathedral city a similar inconvenience to that exist in London be felt from there be a superfluous number of church in particular district and a deficiency of church accommodation in other locality where there be a large population The object of this Bill be not merely to combine two or three church into one but to provide a competent maintenance for the clergy He think their Lordships would allow that if there be two or three small parishes the incumbent of which receive income of less than a year each and or of population it would be a good arrangement that the income should be consolidate and the church themselves unite into one and an active incumbent appoint with one or two curate who would attend to the spiritual want of the inhabitant of the united parish more efficiently than the poor incumbent This he regard a one of the most important object of this Bill His right rev Friend say this Bill introduce a new principle Under the authority of the Legislature however ground set apart in ancient time and dedicate to the worship of God and Christian burial in a particular parish have be take a it be from the Church property and convert to secular purpose for the promotion of great public improvement But what could be an object of great public importance than to make a provision for the spiritual destitution of thousand of perish sinner crowd in suburban district where no mean of pastoral superintendence or place of public worship exist As regard any new principle he make bold to say that what the Church do under the authority of the Legislature the Legislature might be consider to do but he could not for a moment admit that because Parliament give authority to those most interested in the work of supply the spiritual want of the people to carry into effect it wish that therefore the Church commit a breach of it trust by act upon the principle now under discussion Where the Church desire to do it work more effectually and to do this have incidentally to remove some of it ancient landmark for which it have to call in the authority of the Legislature he hold that no new principle and certainly no dangerous principle be thereby introduce On the contrary he think it a great protection for which the Church have reason to be thankful that the Legislature do not interfere with it authority to effect directly the object in view without the intervention of the Church but authorise the ruler of the Church with certain check upon their own discretion to do what the interest of the Church manifestly require There be provincial town to which he consider the provision of this Bill might be apply to very great advantage With regard to the city of Norwich he could speak from personal knowledge and he have no hesitation in express his conviction that in many case it would be for the interest of the Church if the church be unite the clergy would be good provide for and ample church accommodation secure to the parishioner and no doubt the minister would be well able to discharge their duty to the flock commit to their charge As far a he be concerned however he only interest himself about the City of London and he say so far from this be an iconoclastic proposal it be eminently a church extension measure and one to be apply for the benefit of the Church If from other source they could obtain the mean of build new church where they be want it might perhaps be object that they be about to interfere unnecessarily with consecrated edifice but even if they could otherwise obtain the needful mean for build the new church he be not dispose to deny that it might not be well in some case to unite the small parish and introduce a more extended and active ministry into the City of London A great portion of the population of the City have of late year migrate to the suburb and he be of opinion that those person who be now call on to pay tithe in the City of London and who be reap the benefit of the enlarged commerce of that great emporium ought not to complain if part of the present stipend be apply for the spiritual advantage of their who mostly live in district beyond the limit of the City It have be state on a former occasion by a noble Friend of his that there be a sufficient number of poor in the metropolis to fill the church and that the reason the poor be so seldom see in them be that the City church be fill with large square pew which be lock up so that the poor could not enter them He could state that that be really not the case He have make inquiry and have receive report from numerous parish that there be no pew lock up and that there be no difficulty in obtain access to them that seat be provide for the poor inhabitant of the parish more than sufficient to accommodate the whole number of poor resident there The people who attend church resident in the City of London be very few The merchant banker and great trader go away every Saturday and return on Monday to business They have few or no domestic servant in the City and their live at a distance the only person leave upon their premise be porter who have charge of the warehouse and shop and who could not if they would be constant attendant at church It be for this reason that so few worshipper be to be find in many of the City church on Sunday True certain of the City church be pretty well attended and he believe that would always be the case where the parish be sufficiently large and where the clergy do their duty but however able or active a clergyman might be he could not have a full congregation of his own parishioner where there be not parishioner to form a congregation He say then that by assent to this measure they would consult the best interest of the Church violate no sacred principle greatly strengthen the Established Church and encourage the building of new church He would allude to another objection against the measure It bad be ask whether it be likely that person would contribute to the building of new church when it be possible that after the lapse of some year such church might be pull down and the ground upon which they be erect might be sell for secular purpose He the Bishop of London be not afraid that the church which benevolent individual would be likely to build would be erect in place where it be possible that their demolition should happen in any foreseen period of time If such person build church they would build them in populous district where more be want than already exist and to talk of their apprehending that the edifice would be pull down unless the locality be turn into a desert and the population migrate be really to conjure up a phantom to paralyse the effort of those who would otherwise contribute to a good work He have not the slight apprehension that this measure would discourage church build The spirit of church building have happily be excite throughout the country and have manifest itself in numerous instance not only in his own diocese but in the manufacturing district It might be gratify to their Lordships to know that he himself have be instrumental in build church in the metropolis twelve of which have be erect entirely at the cost of private individual He hop if his life be spar a few year longer to complete at least his century of metropolitan church and he be persuade their Lordships would render him most important facility in accomplish that object by assent to the present Bill THE BISHOP OF LINCOLN concur with the right rev Prelate who have just sit down that great spiritual destitution might be occasion by the maintenance of numerous inefficiently endow church The condition of the city of Lincoln in this respect closely resemble that of the City of London Lincoln contain inhabitant and have thirteen small church the large of which afford sitting to person and the clerical income of the thirteen incumbent be a year or an average of something more than each Those among their Lordships who be acquaint with small parish would know under what very great disadvantage the worship of the Church must be carry on in these circumstance He conceive that a great number of small church that be ill endow weaken the efficiency of the Church ministration while there be other overgrown and populous district suffer under great spiritual destitution At the same time it be obvious that few of the clergy would be party to the pull down of superfluous church even to provide church accommodation elsewhere where it be most wanted unless it be do under the conviction that it would enable them to remedy great evil and of course whenever it be do it should take place under sufficiently stringent safeguard It might perhaps be questionable whether the check contain in this Bill be sufficiently stringent but he think it most desirable that the operation of the measure should be extend to the few place where interference be necessary The right rev Prelate below him the Bishop of Oxford have suggest that the experiment should be try in the City of London before the measure be apply to provincial city and towns It have be say Fiat in but the right rev Prelate would first try the effect of the Bill upon million and afterwards upon the less populated district but surely if the experiment be allowable in the metropolis it be allowable in the few other case in which it could be adopt It must be remember that the provision of the Bill could not be carry out immediately for life must drop in and other contingency must occur before parish and endowment could be unite THE OF ROCHESTER address a few word to their Lordships which be inaudible THE EARL OF say that this proposition be not a new experiment to render the Church more elastic but a retrogression to the system of plurality prevalent in former day They ought not to break down the law which have work satisfactorily for fourteen year in the prevention of pluralism but to adopt the Amendment of his noble Friend and limit the operation of this measure to the city of London and Westminster and those few town and city where it might be expedient If there be place to which the provision be applicable there could be no difficulty in name them in a schedule The fact be this be one of those measure that be frame for the metropolis and it vicinity and then extend over the whole of England without sufficient inquiry a to it general applicability The cause of the fall off in the congregation be often plurality and the system of but this Bill call on them to undo the work of the last fifty year in regard to church extension They ought to take care that in their endeavour to obtain a competency for the clergy by unite several living they do not destroy all stimulus to individual exertion and check those effort of private munificence in church building which the noble Earl at the head of the Government have illustrate on the previous even THE BISHOP OF LONDON hop he have not be misunderstand in what he have say respect the observation of his right rev Friend the Bishop of Oxford a to the different mode of perform divine service in the Church of England He have not mean to represent his right rev Friend a have say that he approve that difference but what his right rev Friend have say be that the taste of person a to the performance of religious worship vary materially and that the Church of England allow considerable latitude with respect to the celebration of divine service His right rev Friend mean merely to suggest that fair scope should be allow for a legitimate diversity and not that that diversity should be carry to an extravagant length EARL FITZWILLIAM say he consider that their Lordships would act wisely in adopt the Amendment of the noble Earl He be the more disposed to take that course from what have fall from a right rev Bishop the Bishop of Lincoln whose addition to the Bench every one in the House must rejoice at but in whose view he confess on the present occasion he could not concur That right rev Prelate have tell their Lordships that in the city of Lincoln there be a population of and for those there be thirteen church He be not quite sure whether the right rev Prelate have state it in his speech but he understand that he look to a considerable decrease in the number of church Unless however it could be show that those church be so circumstanced a to be ineffective he do not see that it be desirable to diminish their number Considering that if fairly apportion there would be or person to each church he must be allow to doubt whether there be at Lincoln a superabundance of church accommodation He apprehend that no one would dispute that the City of London would derive great benefit from this Bill but he do not think it be equally clear that it would be a beneficial to other town As it be the intention to trust the provision of this Bill to the management of the respective diocesan with the consent of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners he must entertain a doubt whether it would not be good for Parliament to keep the control in it own hand and inquire into each particular case accord a the necessity arise He be the more inclined to adopt that opinion from what have fall from the right rev the Bishop of Oxford who seem to think that diversity in the service of the church be a very desirable thing and that separate service should be keep up Now though he Earl Fitzwilliam be a liberal Churchman he be not prepared to go that length He should support the Amendment of the noble Earl THE BISHOP OF OXFORD say he think that a a portion of the remark he have make have be misrepresent both by his right rev Friend the Bishop of London and by the noble Earl who have just sit down it be necessary that he should offer some explanation His right rev Friend with his usual candour have acknowledge that in the heat of argument he have make a misrepresentation in some degree of what have fall from him the Bishop of Oxford but a notwithstanding the explanation of his right rev Friend that misrepresentation have be echo by the noble Earl the House would allow him to state what he do and what he do not say He do not say he desire to see separate service in every church or anything like it but he say and he repeat it that the taste of men affect them with respect to religious worship as well a in other thing that the Church of England allow a considerable diversity in the administration of the same service that in the rubric for instance she lay down a certain portion of the service to be say or sing that one congregation greatly preferred and think it increase their devotion to have it sing that another congregation prefer to have it read and that he think it would be exceedingly unwise in any person whether the clergyman of the parish the bishop of the diocese or other individual to attempt in those matter which the Church have leave free to obtrude on a religious congregation a mode of service which it dislike His noble Friend on the Earl Fitzwilliam say that he be a liberal Churchman and he the Bishop of Oxford venture to claim for himself that if in this respect he differ from the noble Earl it be in be a still more liberal Churchman In matter indifferent it be his maxim to advise his clergy to endeavour to ascertain the way in which the people wish to have the service perform within the limit allow by the Church of England to act with them and not to violate their opinion That be his view of this matter and he have never yet hear any argument which could induce him to change his opinion It be because he believe that the do away with church would have a tendency to violate these opinion that he have use the argument he have offer To remove a person who have be accustom to a small church with a quiet service and that quietness of preach that commonly belong to it to a populous church with a large congregation and all the adjunct of music and a particular style of preaching be to him a serious and real evil and it be because he desire the utmost liberty within the limit of the Church of England that he always venture to use the argument THE EARL OF think the question involve by the Amendment be whether they would confine the remedy to one place his noble Friend on the say he should not like to trust the Bishops with the measure but in his opinion the Bishops be far more likely to carry it out in a conservative spirit than otherwise He be afraid that if they be to carry out this principle of consult the taste of individual they would have to have several service a day in each church In reply to the argument that the operation of this Act ought at first to be confine to the city of London and Westminster a an experiment he say that no experiment be need the fact on which it be propose by this Bill to legislate be well know and ascertain If however it would suit the view of his noble Friend Earl Nelson he have no objection between that time and the time the report come before the House to embody in the schedule the name of the place to which the principle of the measure should be apply which it appear to him would do away with the objection EARL NELSON say that this would not satisfy him The measure might operate very well in London where they be tell that there be many parish church without congregation but would it be equally beneficial in other place such a Lincoln for instance They ought to have very strong ground before they proceed to destroy any church and it would not be sufficient to say that it be more agreeable to change a particular church to this or that district Under all the circumstance of the case he should press the Amendment"

104220	"THE ADMINISTRATION.]_1834"	"Lord call their Lordships attention to the fact that the Irish Coercion Bill be appoint for the third reading but no day have be name and he wish to know whether any member of the Administration if an Administration have be form meant to make a statement of the view of Government with respect to that measure The Lord Chancellor answer that his noble friend Viscount Melbourne who be not then in his place would be present and would then answer the question He have leave his noble friend at the Palace in the morning and a Government have be form The Marquess of Londonderry wish to know with reference to what have recently be state by the noble and learn Lord on the whether a noble Viscount a Member of the other House still retain his place in the Administration A noble Earl Earl Grey have on a former occasion describe him a the of the Government now he want to learn whether that have come back to the old body As the noble and learn Lord have on this occasion afford them some information with respect to the Ministry perhaps he would answer this question The Duke of Richmond be of opinion that it be extremely inexpedient to put such a question to his noble and learn friend on the at the present moment He do not think that it be act fairly to his noble and learned friend particularly when it be know that the other House have adjourn till at which time the noble Lord who have be allude to would of course make his own statement The Lord Chancellor do not think it a very logical inference on the part of the noble Marquess that because he have give one piece of information he be therefore bound to give another He have however no objection to say and he should be very sorry if he could not say that his noble friend to whom allusion have be make be still Chancellor of the Exchequer and he entirely agree in the statement of his noble friend who be lately at the head of his Majesty Government as well a in the observation however meant of the noble Marquess himself that in whatever Administration his noble friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer be place he must still be look on a the of that Administration He the Lord Chancellor could not fancy any Administration of which his noble friend should be a Member that would not think him worthy of that appellation Lord agree with the noble Duke Duke of Richmond a to the inexpediency of make any observation on the subject but he think it be proper that the fact of the noble Lord the Chancellor of the Exchequer retain office should be know The Marquess of Londonderry say the noble Viscount Viscount Melbourne have on a former evening state that he have seek the of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in form an Administration but he have not say that that noble Lord be to be replace In fact that noble Lord have state elsewhere that he have positively resign The Duke of Wellington say the noble Lord the Chancellor of the Exchequer have tender his resignation but have not formally resign The Lord Chancellor observe that what be commonly call resigning be tender a resignation but it be not formally accept until a new appointment be make The Marquess of Londonderry say the noble Viscount have himself declare in the other House that he have give in his resignation that it be receive and that the Government be virtually dissolve The Lord Chancellor wish once more to set this matter right His noble friend in the other House do not say that the Government be virtually dissolve What he say be that he understand that at that time or before that time when he be address the Commons his noble friend Earl Grey have state to this House that the Government be virtually dissolve That be however altogether a mistake arise from misinformation for the noble Earl have never in the whole course of his statement say any such thing Lord I take the opportunity of move a new writ for the purpose of state to the House that Lord Melbourne have be commission by his Majesty to lay before him the plan of an Administration have complete his arrangement and have reconstruct the Cabinet The addition make to the Ministry be that Lord have accept the office of Secretary of State for the Home Department Sir John Cam have be appoint to the Woods and Forests instead of Lord with a seat in the Cabinet Therefore as far a relates to any addition the alteration in the Cabinet will not be very great but undoubtedly the alteration in the Cabinet be great very great indeed in the loss of the service of Lord Grey and it be impossible for me to disguise from myself it would be hypocrisy in me be I to state to the House that I think the Cabinet deprived of Lord Grey a presiding over it Councils could have a strong a claim upon the confidence of the country a before his retirement On public ground it be impossible for me to express my regret more strongly than I feel it and on personal ground it impress me still more deeply During the whole of my political life I have look up to Lord Grey a my tutor and leader Such he have continue to me from the early moment that I have a seat in Parliament and I certainly never would have accept office unless to assist Lord Grey in the establishment of a Government At that time we have the prospect before u of be able to accomplish the great object of Parliamentary Reform In addition I may say that even with this prospect I never would have consent to accept office have not Lord Grey be place at the head of the Ministry Since that period the intimacy of my political connexion have greatly increase my personal attachment In every respect in which an amiable disposition can produce in those connect with it regard and affection there be no man who possess that quality more highly than Lord Grey So much I may say of his temper and character but my admiration of the ability of Lord Grey be high than for the ability of any other man My esteem for his upright and straightforward policy be equally great and with these feeling I consider the loss of Lord Grey from the Cabinet a nearly irreparable a possible His Majesty have now be please to place Lord Melbourne at the head of the Government and I be perfectly ready to state it a my sincere conviction that his Majesty would not have make so wise a choice have he go to any other quarter Lord Melbourne possess great ability natural and acquire great and great decision These the House will be aware be quality very necessary in the first Minister of this country and as far a my own opinion be concern I may mention that I have have the satisfaction of concur with Lord Melbourne in most of the subject bring under the discussion of the Cabinet Under these circumstance his Majesty have be graciously pleased to require the continuance of my service It be at no time agreeable for a man to speak of himself it be neither pleasant to him nor to his hearer but I be in a manner bound on this occasion to say a few word respect my own conduct I have always have a I believe be pretty generally know a great disinclination to be in office I will not say that the experience I have have of it have at all diminish that disinclination but besides this constant private feeling I felt that there be circumstance in the present state of affair which increase my desire to relinquish office This desire I state to Lord Grey aware at the time that my resignation would be likely to cause also the retirement of his Lordship Hence my disinclination to quit my post but I should certainly have leave it have I think that Lord Grey would have continue to retain his situation It be Lord Grey strong and earnest advice to me to remain where I be but these be all private matter with which in fact the House have little or nothing to do I be oblige to say that if I look to public duty I saw every reason for continue my service such a they be I could not in fact find one ground of a public nature justify my relinquishment and such be the case I felt it my imperative duty to act a I have do I do not know that on the formation of the Ministry it be necessary for me to say more I only wish to add in a very few word and a very few word will suffice something of the principle on which we mean to act The principle on which I conceive the Administration of Great Britain be bind to proceed be that while it preserve the institution of the country it will carry forward such reasonable and effectual reform a the people have a right to expect would be the consequence of the Reform in Parliament While it feel it it bounden duty not to propose anything which can produce danger to the institution of the country it should take care that the remedy be neither more than adequate nor less than adequate to the evil intend to be remedied All should be arrange and settle accord to the exist circumstance of the country This I will say be the principle on which the Government of Lord Grey proceed it have meet with obstruction and difficulty but such be it principle and such ought to be the principle of every Administration Upon that principle we be now prepared to act we too may meet with obstruction and difficulty but if we do we will endeavour to overcome them I beg to move that the Speaker issue his warrant for a new writ for the election of a burgess for the borough of Nottingham in the room of Viscount who have accept the office of one of his Majesty principal Secretaries of State Colonel Evans say that he wish to make one or two observation He hop that the Government now form would by proceed more consonantly with the feeling of the people acquire strength from possess their confidence but the noble Lord have say that the principle would be the same a that of Lord Grey Administration if so it would not fulfil the just expectation of the people by carry forward the improvement consequent upon the Reform of Parliament He have chiefly rise to advert to a that have occur within a very few day he allude to an address present to the noble Lord Lord which he among others have be invite to sign He have refuse and it be due to his constituent and to himself to state shortly why he have decline it Few Members be circumstanced like himself and he think it incumbent upon him to state his reason He be quite aware that the great majority of those who hear him have subscribe the address and notwithstanding the ejaculation by which he be meet a he have good reason for refuse be hop he might be allow to mention them Every individual however humble have a character to defend and he know that some few of his friend have adopt the same course a himself He have not refuse to add his name from any factious feeling but merely because he think the practice of address member of the Government be grow into a system and to that system he object When the Government be in a state of disorganization the member for Middlesex have move a be both usual and proper the temporary adjournment of the House If then Parliament suspend it function in order that the Sovereign might exercise his free choice surely it be not too much to expect that Members would suspend also their individual operation If this custom be allow to proceed what would be the consequence It would in some degree prevent the Sovereign from exercise a free choice since he could not but receive some bias from what he know be go on out of door Did it not also in some degree transfer the function of Parliament to club and cabal He have no doubt that the party who get up the address to the noble Lord have no such intention but if it become a regular practice such must be the result Clubs and cabal would settle the Ministry while the Sovereign be coerce He venture also to say that he be at a loss to understand how many of his friend who have frequently oppose the measure of Government could bring themselves to sign such an address for there be not one expression in it which indicate the slight disapprobation or the past conduct of Ministers hence it amount to a virtual approbation of the whole conduct of Government He hop something from the tone of the speech of the noble Lord and agree that the Government and the country have sustain a severe loss in the resignation of Lord Grey The present Cabinet would however be well able to carry forward the principle of Reform a the last Government have be well able to comply with the wish of the people than the Administration which precede it Tennyson concur in what have be say by his and gallant friend on the subject of address and on the manner in which they control in a degree the prerogative of the King The noble Lord have declare that the principle of the present Government would be to carry forward reasonable reform while it maintain the just right of the Crown and support the ancient institution of the country and he Tennyson deem it his duty to give confidence in the first instance to any Ministry his Majesty might think fit to appoint On this occasion he be satisfy that the noble Lord would not have consent to appear in the place he occupy have he not felt assure that he be associate with men who would act upon the principle he have avow He trust therefore that such Members a have sign the address would be prepare to support the noble Lord and his colleague until they saw a clear departure from the plan upon which they say they be resolve to proceed Nothing could be more satisfactory to the nation than the general of all liberal men to accomplish the general good and whenever a great principle be admit he hop that people would not be too critical in scan the particular mode in which it be carry into execution Let every Member be actuate by a strong desire to do his duty to his constituent and by an earnest wish to obtain those benefit which the Reform Bill be calculate to produce He especially exhort his and gallant friend Colonel Evans to concur with him in the course he be determine to pursue namely to place confidence in the present Administration because by the noble Lord that confidence be chiefly deserved Matthias say he hear with satisfaction that part of the noble Lord statement in which he who so recently announce the dissolution of an Administration now inform the House that a Ministry be and that the House be to proceed with it suspended business and duties The observation of the gallant member for Westminster deserve the serious consideration of the House in the altered circumstance in which they be now place For nearly a fortnight the proceeding of Parliament have be interrupt at a period of the Session advance indeed in point of time but not advanced in the public business when the business of the House yet remain though the Members would be absent and he ask under what circumstance No Administration have be drive from office by political opponent with the forfeited confidence of the House of Commons to give place to a new Ministry with new measure No political opponent attack the late Administration desirous of or even willing to accept their seat They possess the confidence of the House of Commons and of the King and in fact of every branch of the Legislature in as great a degree at the moment they abandon power a at any period since their accession to office The Administration have fall to piece by it own weakness with no opponent but amongst themselves censure and condemn the measure each one of the other have the Administration abandon their place and take them up again and the whole business of Parliament be suspend to enable the Ministry to reconcile their personal dissension or to agree on their political principle But then the dissension have grow to such a height a to deprive the House of the presence of Ministers responsible for the act of the Crown The House be however place in circumstance different from those by which the conduct of former Parliaments be govern on similar occasion Recent experience have show the grow uncertainty of the presence in that House of the Ministers of the Crown The King might appoint to public office those whom the people would refuse to elect to seat in Parliament They have be without the assistance during a great part of this Session of the principal law adviser of the Crown Very nearly be the House deprive of the assistance of his right friend the Secretary for the Colonies The noble Lord have tell them he have resign the office of Chancellor of the Exchequer If that be so and he again accept it the House would in all probability lose the advantage of the presence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer The noble Lord intimate his dissent Why probably the noble Lord would contrive by some device of office to accept an office from the favour of the Crown and still retain his seat in Parliament in despite of the distrust of his constituency in Northamptonshire The right Gentleman beside him have already give such an example have take the office of President of the Board of Trade and avoid by an ingenious device the necessity of present himself again to his constituent at Manchester It be impossible to regard these proceeding without recall the speech of the noble Lord more than three short year back when difficulty such a the present be point out to him a the consequence of his meditated measure He do not then point out the course he now adopt The noble Lord say that if the Ministers of the Crown could not secure their credit with their constituent they ought neither to be return to nor to sit in Parliament The noble Lord recent conduct be a singular illustration of his recorded principle But it be not for the House to guide it conduct by the success or failure of shift such a the noble Lord have resort to but by reference to the situation they be place in they ought to consider in time the necessity of adapt their proceeding to their alter circumstance They would derive some light a to their situation in this respect by reference more closely to recent proceeding They hear the noble Lord tell them that himself and sundry of his colleague have resign and that the Administration be dissolve but in the same hour another noble Lord contradict in another place this assertion and affirm that the noble Lord colleague have not resign and that the Administration be not dissolve Whence that contradiction The noble Lord opposite be cognisant of the fact of which he speak and be remove from all suspicion of desire to misinform the House The other noble Lord be equally cognisant of the fact and equally incapable of desire to mislead the House of Lords Both be right the Ministers have resign in one sense and not in another They have resign their office into the hand of the King but with an eye to keep their seat in Parliament without the aid of their constituent in case his Majesty should call them back to office They have confidence in the King they his Majesty with their office but have no confidence in the people and fear to trust them with their seat Thus they proceed hold their seat in defiance of all their principle as well a of all their constituent They break to piece with no political party oppose to them censure and condemn the measure each of the other The noble Lord the Chancellor of the Exchequer describing a abortive the whole Irish policy of the late right Secretary for Ireland condemning in still strong term the policy of the present Secretary for Ireland the late Irish Secretary condemn the measure of the noble Lord describe the policy of the Administration a full of juggle chicanery Lord Grey condemn the House of Commons ascribe the embarrassment of his Ministry to the nature of the motion and of the business which occupy the labour of the House These be matter of grave consideration when the same men with few change be soon about to take again the rein of power But the most important feature in these proceeding be an Administration possess the confidence of the House which have lose the confidence of the country What course of policy or system of measure of duty neglect or discharge have sever that House from the people If they turn from the ignominious close of the power of Lord Grey to it commencement they would see whence this have sprung Lord Grey when he first enter office declare the general policy on which his Ministry should proceed The lesson to be derive from the fate of his predecessor in office be then recent He say before he be three hour instal in office in word which be fit to be now call to the recollection of the House that the people be not to be satisfy with a measure of Reform when so many evil be press on them to which no remedy have be apply On the contrary he say state of the country shall be the object of our immediate our and unceasing of our first and anxious attention relieve the noble Earl add distress which so unhappily exists in different part the country will be the first and most object of our deliberation It third series be in an evil hour for his power and the country that Lord Grey abandon that resolution and betray the duty he prescribe His Administration have inquire into no distress nor redress any of the real grievance of the people They disregard the circumstance in which the people be place and direct their exclusive attention to effect innovation in the institution under which they live and the law and system by which they be govern How have the House itself be occupy night after night Session after Session they be engage in ameliorate a they call it every institution change every law improve every system In this they proceed a they imagine in accordance with the spirit of the present time satisfy the desire and comply with the demand of the people But comply a they imagine with the demand they have lose the confidence of the people No body of men assemble within those wall be less trust by the country than themselves Again they hear those who boast the loud at one time of proceed with the spirit of the age complain at other time of what they call the pressure from without and implore even their opponent in humiliate term to protect them from that pressure and the country from danger thus threaten Did not these thing point out that they mistake the character of the real spirit of the time and of the real want and demand of the people The people value in fact their institution and law by the benefit they dispense and the advantage they confer If wealth be diffuse amongst the people industry render prosperous employment give to the labourer and the great body of the productive class satisfy with plenty the people would be content with institution which philosopher might consider less than perfect and support them with a loyalty and devotion without which on the part of the people no institution would be stable But if embarrassment and difficulty pervade productive industry if the increase poverty of the productive class be only bring into strong contrast by the increase luxury of the unproductive if luxury and pauperism be now increase together if the resource of industry and prudence be fruitless labour without adequate employment or reward the people would regard institution the most perfect and those by whom they be administer with suspicion and distrust and if unfortunately they have be teach to look for improvement in their circumstance to political innovation then with each successive disappointment they would demand further experiment and the foundation would thus be lay for the pressure of which they the Ministers complain and from which they could have no relief except by apply themselves to remove it cause by direct the labour of Parliament to redress the grievance and alleviate the distress of the country These be the lesson which it seem to him the past taught them The Administration now form if it neglect those lesson would encounter a many difficulty and end in as much disgrace a the last but there be yet time to regain by a different policy the lose confidence of the country and place the security of their institution on the only sure foundation they could rest on the prosperity and attachment of the people Sir Robert Peel As regard the expression of a little impatience by the House of some part of the speech of one so much entitle to attention a be my friend The House have betray some impatience when be speak I infer not a disposition on the part of the House to interrupt my friend in the delivery of his opinion nor that the House deem unworthy their consideration anything that might fall from him but rather a feeling in which I must confess I participate that it may be good to postpone the consideration of the effect the late change in his Majesty Government be likely to produce till there shall be bring under the consideration of the House and emanate from his Majesty Government some more distinct measure than the mere moving of a new writ Being persuade that such be the general feeling of the House I will so far conform to it that I will abstain on the present occasion from make any observation on the probable policy or what may be the consequence of the policy of the present Government The noble Lord opposite have however state in very general term what be the principle on which the Government have be form he will perhaps not object more particularly a we have now arrive at the of July and the Session must be draw to a close I say perhaps the noble Lord opposite will not under these circumstance think it an unreasonable request if I ask him to explain further with reference to those measure now before Parliament what be the application of the general principle on which the Government profess to be found On look into the I find that there be three measure which properly bear the name of Government measure and they be perhaps the only measure in that book that be entitle to such a designation I wish to ask the noble Lord then whether it be his intention to persevere in the first instance with the measure respect and with the substitution propose of some other charge for those rate The second question I would ask be what course his Majesty Government intend to pursue with respect to the Irish Tithe Bill The third question I have to ask be whether his Majesty Government propose to persevere with the Irish Coercion Bill in the form in which it be bring in by the late Government or whether they will substitute any other and if so what be the modification that be contemplate It seem to me probable that the noble Lord will not be unwilling to make an explicit declaration a to these matter I trust that at all event he will not think my request by any mean improper Lord In reply to the right Gentleman I beg to state that a regard the Irish Tithe Bill it be the intention of his Majesty Government to persevere with that measure With respect to the last question of the right Gentleman I have to inform him that I shall give notice of my intention to move tomorrow for leave to bring in a Bill to renew the Coercion Act with certain modification the nature of which when I make the Motion I shall state to the House With respect to the other question I be not quite prepared to state whether his Majesty Government will have time to carry the measure to which he refer through Parliament this Session therefore if he will allow me to that question I will not give him an answer Baring say in look at the course his Majesty Government be likely to pursue he could not help express his apprehension that the security the country possess that his Majesty Ministers would not go to extremes be lose with the noble Lord who have leave the Administration He have always entertain the great respect for the noble Earl a one of the chief of a party he have follow for a great many year till he saw the necessity of the noble Earl when a Prime Minister lie brought forward measure endanger a he think the best institution of the country Still he place great reliance on what he know to be the honourable and upright intention of the noble Lord he felt confident that the noble Lord would see the necessity of stop somewhere that he would not go on urge them headlong in a course of what the noble Lord opposite and his colleague might call Reform and improvement but which the country would describe in very different term He repeat that the noble Earl be a security to the country that the Government of which he be the head would not adopt extreme measure But the whole circumstance of the change which have now take place the manner in which it be make the manner even in which that support have be give to which there have be an allusion and which have be so irregularly promote through the club of James by way of advice to his Majesty Ministers No no If not to his Majesty Ministers to his Majesty in the exercise of his prerogative Looking to the quarter from which this measure proceed and to the eager support which the noble Lord opposite receive from those who no doubt believe they be discharge their duty conscientiously but who be generally to be find array themselves in favour of measure which in his opinion would involve the monarchy and with the monarchy the liberty of the country Taking into his consideration all these circumstance he could not help think that the formation of the present Government justify extreme anxiety and apprehension While some thought improvement which be their name for revolutionary change could not march too precipitately the great mass comprehend the property and intelligence of the country entertain a very different opinion The former could not fail to have their satisfaction particularly increase by the change that have occur He allude more particularly to the appointment of the noble Lord Lord to the office of Home Secretary He to the great possible degree personal respect for the noble Lord and he have enjoy the advantage of that noble Lord private friendship He should be believe then when he say that it be with deep regret he felt himself call on to declare his conviction that if the opinion of the noble Lord be allow to prevail in the Government the consequence would be nothing short of ruin to the whole of Ireland in fact the institution of that country would be place at the foot of the and learn Gentleman the member for Dublin What be the object of the policy of the and learn Gentleman in Ireland he need not stay to inquire because that and learn Gentleman have over and over again announce them Bearing those object in mind then he repeat his apprehension that the Protestant institution and interest in Ireland would be completely place at the foot of the and learn Gentleman With respect to the landed interest of the country he would say nothing far than that the majority of the former Cabinet be adverse to it or to those measure which the landed interest consider essential to it protection Considerable reliance however be place in the noble Lord who have retire and who be it chief support He could not therefore now avoid entertain considerable apprehension for that interest which be the one with which he be more immediately connect He would not allude to what might be the personal feeling of the noble Lord on again accept office of the propriety of that act he the noble Lord be himself the best judge but he would speak of the public consideration arise out of the change and have no great confidence in the Government a it exist before he should look to the measure of the present Government with additional jealousy and apprehension He entertain these feeling more particularly with reference to the maintenance of the Protestant Church of Ireland and the Protestant interest of Ireland He apprehend that in the same manner in which the Church of Ireland be to be violently deal with would there be an attempt hereafter to deal with the Church of England Seeing from the whole colour and drift of the change that have take place that they be likely to affect those institution of the country which in his conscience he believe essential to the maintenance of it liberty and civilization he could not look at the change without feel considerable embarrassment The best thing that could now happen to them be that the noble Lord opposite should have the power to get rid of the business of the Session and that the Parliament should be prorogue Gentlemen now suffer great inconvenience in the present state of the atmosphere of the town and their presence be most essential in the country more particularly if the change contemplate in the be to be carry into effect That alteration would render their presence in the country of the utmost importance He therefore sincerely hop that the noble Lord would put forward the business of the country and in the mean time explain to them what it present state be He wish to hear from the noble Lord some statement with reference to the budget Great change have take place in both our receipt and expenditure yet no notice have hitherto be give a to when the financial statement would be bring forward They have notice of other measure and the right Gentleman the President of the Board of Trade have lately make a statement something in the nature of a budget remit taxation to the amount of or What have be do by the right Gentleman have usually be do by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in a somewhat more regular way They now have the force march together without any apparent object in common In the management of public affair the settlement of the finance of the country use to be consider the most important but they have be sit month after month do nothing except listen to vague discussion on subject in which the country take little interest Before the noble Lord bring on his budget he should move for the production of a paper which would show the entire failure of the noble Lord plan for the reduction of the four per cent say unlike the member for Essex who have lug in head and shoulder matter on which to find complaint against the present Government he rise to express the heartfelt gratification he derive from hear the noble Lord opposite announce that he be to introduce the Bill which he call a Coercion Bill He would implore the noble Lord to take up only the peace preservation portion of the Act those portion which give the power to proclaim disturbed district and to increase the number of the police in a disturbed district If the noble Lord resort only to this the measure would be properly describe not a the noble Lord have call it but by it technical title of The Peace Preservation Bill for Ireland If the Bill go no further than this he do believe it would have the support of every member for Ireland who sit in that House At all event it would have all the support which could be afford to it by the humble individual who be then address the House No one be more anxious than he be to give efficacy to a measure practically to ensure peace and the protection of property and thus to enable person to remain in their house instead of be force to quit them by the disturber of public peace and the violator of the right of property He could not but think that the course which the noble Lord have pursue be a complete vindication of those independent men in that House who have express the strong anxiety with respect to this measure and nothing be more proper than that the noble Lord who have retire from the Administration on account of his opposition to the Coercion Bill should on the principle that it be to be greatly modified return to office As to the Tithe Bill it deserve the deep consideration and he hop he should be able to show that in the arrangement of that Bill however it might have be and he believe it to have be so yet instead of mitigate the evil it most unfortunately would tend to aggravate them If he could establish this he do not despair of some other course be adopt by his Majesty Government He would recommend the postponement of this measure for the present and they could then bring forward a measure more mature at the commencement of another Session That he hop the present Government would consent to do and have say so much he would have resume his seat but for some observation in which the member for Essex have indulge in which he have allude particularly to him and to a noble Lord who if permit to do so he would call in the language of the House his noble friend As to himself the member for Essex say that his object be perfectly well known He be much oblige to the Gentleman for so say He wish to act with perfect courtesy to that Member but he could not return the compliment He have be long enough a Member of the House to have hear the Gentleman advocate with equal ability the principle of one side at one time and of the opposite side at another time so that it be far from easy to say what be the object of the Gentleman Nay in one and the same speech he have hear the Gentleman if he mistake not advocate both side However sensitive the Gentleman might be a regarded the Protestant establishment in Ireland and however anxious he might be to preserve it for the sake of the purity of the Protestant faith the Member must surely allow that the late member for Nottingham be quite as good a Protestant a the Member himself When the Gentleman say that Ireland would suffer from that noble Lord have join the Administration he would ask the Gentleman in what respect he could compare with that noble Lord He would ask what connection with Ireland have the Gentleman who venture that assertion While on the other hand be not the noble Lord intimately connect with the interest of the country have he not the strong tie of property and of hereditary honour Did the Gentleman know that in Ireland there live no family whose name be so honourably connect with the bright period of her history or that be good know a the advocate of popular measure and at the same time the most decided enemy of every faction and measure injurious to the stability of the Throne or threaten to the liberty of the country The accession of the noble Lord to office would be a source of great delight to the Irish people They would see in it a pledge to them that it be the intention of the Government to act for the benefit of their country that there would be no more measure for the mere support of a faction that the instrument of faction would be lay aside and that Ireland would at last have the advantage of a liberal and enlightened Government That noble Lord know Ireland perfectly and love her well and Ins appointment to office be a pledge that his Majesty Government seriously honestly and manfully intend to look into the grievous abuse exist with a view to their removal He hail it a a symptom of a most pleasing nature that the noble Lord be invest with power It would be in vain to say that lie have any personal object in eulogise the noble Lord it be sufficiently well know that no one have more firmness of purpose that there be not an individual who be less likely to be influence in his by any such appeal The noble Lord be one whose be form by act and who be incapable of be sway by anything which he might say in his praise indeed it could not be worth his while to accept from him this humble tribute to his worth Talking of the noble Lord name tarnish the present Administration he hail it a the harbinger of peace to Ireland and of honour and dignity to the Government be one of those who be anxious that the present Cabinet should be able to maintain their position in the country and he trust they would do so by work out the principle upon which they have be support The Administration have suffer successive reduction and alteration and have at last assume the character of a pure old Whig party Sir Robert Peel interrupt the Member to observe that the present Government could not be say to consist of nothing but pure old Whigs if it be part of the character of pure old Whigs to support pure old Whig principle There be More than one individual on the Ministerial bench who could not lay claim to the denomination of a pure old Whig continue The real question a to the present Government be whether they be prepare resolutely to carry the measure which the country require and which the people loudly call for or whether they intend to continue the same course of half measure and quarter measure which the late Administration have pursue Viscount complain that the right Baronet opposite have think proper to make personal allusion to himself and his right friend Grant by point to them and observe that there be at least two Tories in the present Administration Sir Robert Peel My remark be make in consequence of what fell from the Gentleman who have just speak That Gentleman say that the Tory member of the late Government have be gradually wheel out and that the present Government be a compound of pure old Whigs I observe that this be a mistake that they be not pure old Whigs whereupon the Gentleman conclude that I mean to say that they be Radicals This I deny What I mean to say be that the present Government do not consist of pure old Whigs I do not say that they be Tory but that they do not come under the ordinary denomination of pure old Whigs I recollect the noble Lord belong to the Government of to the Government of Lord Liverpool to the Government of Canning to the Government of Lord and I think that inasmuch a he be a person who have one of each of these Governments he could not come under the denomination of a pure old Whig Viscount All I rise to say be that if the right Baronet meant to imply that myself and my right friend be Tories then certainly he have inspire me with some hope of a speedy improvement in the present condition of the country I and my right friend take an active part in forward the measure of Parliamentary Reform we be also prepare to act on those principle which my noble friend Lord have state to the House this evening honestly and boldly to examine all the institution of the country with a view not to destroy but to strengthen them by remedy their abuse and defect and if such be our principle and our view we fall under the denomination of Tories I be happy to hear the right Baronet say so because a a natural consequence I conclude that we be likely to have his support and the support of his friend in our effort to carry those measure of improvement which we may feel it to be our duty to bring before the House I must add that I do not think the right Baronet be well treat by the member for Essex The right Baronet with his usual good taste and state that he should not on the present occasion go into any detailed criticism of the measure of the late or the present Administrations The member for Essex however have begin by tell u that he have be devote through life in personal feeling and public respect to the noble Lord who have retire from the Administration Baring interrupt the noble Lord Really the noble Lord be quote what never say I do not state that I have be devote through life to the noble Lord What I say be that I be an humble follower of the noble Lord in party politics up to the period of the change when the Reform Bills be introduce I do not say that I be devote through life to the noble Lord because for several year past the measure of the noble Lord have be such a I could not approve Viscount Really I have not mistake the meaning of the Gentleman the correction be not very material The Gentleman tell u then that he have be the follower of the noble Lord during the great part of his life because he respect his private and personal conduct and approve of his public principle But it happen that precisely at the moment when the noble Lord be in a situation in which he could carry his political principle into effect that I say be the moment in which the Member think fit to change his colour and to enter into an active opposition to those measure which he formerly support That be the course which this Member have pursue towards his leader let u now see what his course be to another The member fight now under the banner of I do not say he be bind absolutely thereby but he be act apparently in concert with the right Baronet Instead however of follow the good example of the right Gentleman upon this occasion he do precisely the reverse of that which his leader have do It be not necessary for me to go into a reply to what have fall from the Gentleman respect the noble Lord who now fill the office of Home Secretary I agree entirely with what have fall on that subject front the and learn Gentleman the member for Dublin I trust that the present Government will obtain the support confidence and approbation of this House and the country and I have a perfect conviction from my long acquaintance with the noble Lord that his measure will redound to the advantage and happiness of the empire Sir Henry say he should not have say a word upon the present occasion have it not be for the unmeasured attack which have be direct against his friend Baring by the noble Lord His friend be accuse of have desert the party of Earl Grey Yet in his Sir Henry opinion the circumstance under which his friend have secede from the party of the late Administration redound highly to his honour As soon a he be induce to consider that the policy of the noble Earl Administration threaten danger to the State he withdraw his support from them and that be at the very time when the party he have hitherto be connect with have come into the possession of power The conduct of the noble Lord have be very different The noble Lord have be in the Administration of Lord Liverpool Canning Earl and the Duke of Wellington he have be with every Tory Administration up to the formation of the present Ministry and under these circumstance his friend need not fear any parallel with the noble Lord After the noble Lord have be twenty year a Tory and have approve of Tory principle he ought not to be angry when he be remind that he have not always belong to the Whig party Perhaps the term of pure old Whig might not exactly suit him either He might therefore be call a juvenile Whig a pure juvenile Whig With respect to the formation of the present Government the only alteration he could find in it be that they have get rid of Earl Grey the leader of the Whig party who be make the sole victim and go out without a single follower from amongst all his recent associate and supporter The noble Earl go out of office because he could not command the of his colleague in office to pass a Bill which the noble Earl Grey consider necessary for the tranquillity of Ireland and the Noble Lord who have himself resigned office now consent to return to it It be not the proper time to discuss the principle of that measure but when the Coercion Bill be bring in he should he prepare to do so Viscount I beg to remind the House since this matter have assume a personal complexion that I leave the Administration of the Duke of Wellington at a time when in all human probability the reign in office of in Administration be likely to be of very considerable duration I differ with the member of that Government and I leave them on a question not of importance certainly but it be a question of reform Baring Blame appear to have be impute to Me because I could not concur with those extraordinary measure of change which be bring forward by the noble Earl Now I wish to state that I never at any one period of my life vote for any general measure of Reform laughter I do know what be mean by that laugh It be a fact that during the thirty year I have sit in Parliament I never vote for any general measure of Reform though I have vote for such measure a the extension of the franchise to Manchester Birmingham and other great manufacturing town and for increase the representation of Scotland Nor have I ever any reason to suppose that the party I act with meditated Reform of that description which be at last carry I believe that Reform would not have be effect to so great an extent have it not be for the change which occur in the Administration The measure which about that period be to have be bring forward by the noble and learned Lord who be then Brougham be of a very different character and in support of that in all probability I should have give my vote William Peter defend Ministers from the attack which have be make upon them In spite of the sneer and taunt of the Gentleman opposite he would maintain that a pure a more enlightened Administration have never sway the destiny of tin great Empire an Administration which have do so much to diminish the and to extend the liberty of the country They have be true to their principle and faithful to their profession What have be their pledge on take office Their pledge be Peace Economy and Reform and honestly and nobly have they be redeem them Notwithstanding the cloud which lower in the political horizon notwithstanding the convulsed state of Europe from one extremity to the other notwithstanding the prophecy of the member for Essex Baring who have pronounce it impossible to preserve peace for three month yet peace thanks to the generous and lightened policy of the Government peace have be preserve for three year With respect to their next pledge that of economy it be well know to the House that begin with their own salary Ministers have reduce the expense of every department in the State They have abolish nearly office and out of an expenditure of fifteen million all over which they have any control the remain income of the country be swallow up by the dead weight and the interest of the national debt they have save nearly four million So much for economy As for liberty and Reform it be enough to say that they have abolish monopoly in the East and extinguish slavery in the West that they have break down the fence of corruption and tyranny at home and popular freedom on the sure and lasting basis of popular Representation These be deed which would long live in the memory of their country and of mankind But amidst the sneer and taunt and vituperation with which Gentlemen have assail the present Ministers he Peter be gratify to hear an Member Baring do justice to the noble Earl so lately at the head of his Majesty Councils However tardy the be still welcome wrung a it have be from one who have so violently and invariably oppose all his measure Now that Lord Grey be go the Member felt his loss and be reluctantly oblige to confess his worth But thus it often happen ex He Peter be no flatterer of the noble Earl or of any other Minister but this much he would say that if ever there be a Minister who above all others deserve well of his country that Minister be Earl Grey Yes in spite of every sneer and attack he would repeat that if ever there be a Minister if ever there be a man whose long course of public and private virtue whose unshrinking devotion to the best interest of his country whose tried and consistency in the great cause of liberty and Reform entitle him above others to the gratitude of a just and enlightened people that man be Earl Grey When the feud of party should have pass away when the clamour of faction should be hush in the oblivious silence of the grave when the character of departed statesman should be only honour for their virtue or only reprobate for their crime the name of Grey of the author of the great the beneficent the enlightened measure of Reform would be find in that proud list which consecrate a a and a Fox to the eternal gratitude of their admiring country Henry felt that the new Ministry as far a the measure contemplate towards Ireland be regard instead of throw that country into the hand of the and learn Member for Dublin would by act a they propose rather take Ireland out of the hand of that and learn Gentleman He deny the statement make by a noble Duke in the other House that more blood be shed under the late Administration than that of any which precede it and contend that more blood have be shed in Ireland at the period when the noble Duke himself have be Secretary for that country He would caution the Government not to take the advice of their false friends the Tories who would support convulsion He be hostile to convulsion and separation and the next best thing he would do be to oppose the Tories Not long ago party of arm men parade within a few yard of the house of two Magistrates and fired shot in perfect security a they be To such a system he would not wish to return He hop the Government would if possible carry the Tithe Bill this Session or if not that they would adopt the suggestion of and bring in a short Bill Something be necessary to secure the peace of the country and for his part he would sacrifice a portion of his property to attain that object He give the Gentlemen opposite credit for what they have do and though he do not think it proper to sign a certain paper he still might concur in some degree in it sentiment He now felt satisfied that he have clone well in not sign the paper a the support which he hop their measure would enable him to give them would come with a good grace"
120098	"VOTE OF THANKS TO THE ALLIED FORCES IN THE CRIMEA._1854"	"LORD JOHN RUSSELL Sir in rise to perform the task which I have under take I have the satisfaction of know that however feebly or incompletely that task may be perform I shall have the sympathy of this House I can not doubt that all those who be concern in and who approve the expedition that have be send to the Crimea will cordially join in acknowledge the deed of valour constancy and fortitude which have be and which they have a right to expect would be perform and I should say still more strongly that those who think that the expedition be unwise that it be undertake with inadequate mean and that our army be expose to duty for which it be unequal will still more be incline to admire the superhuman effort that have be make by that army I therefore Sir proceed with this task in full confidence that the House will heartily approve of the Motions which I be about to submit to them In perform that task I may perhaps say at the outset that I shall endeavour as far a possible to avoid repeat the detail of action a narrative of which have be give by Lord Raglan in his own clear and admirable language I shall also endeavour to avoid enter into any question of tactic or of military criticism I hold that we be none of u well qualify to perform that task one which can only be adequately perform by those who be not only practically familiar with the art of war but who also know all the circumstance of the operation which have be undertaken and of the manner in which those operation have be conduct If I be to give an illustration of my meaning I would mention that in a History of the French Empire the historian in recount the operation which occur at the battle of state that the first Napoleon have carry the battle to a certain extent and see the victory incline in his favour order certain manoeuvre to be perform but that he say afterwards that there be another manoeuvre which would have be far more decisive and would have lead to far more splendid result but that a his army be not at that time compose of those veteran who be accustom to war a many of his troop be young and inexperienced he could not rely upon their steadiness for the manoeuvre which be of a difficult and delicate nature Now Sir a military critic have discover that such a manoeuvre might have be perform might have easily blame that great commander for not have undertake it but he know all the circumstance and be aware of his position the ground on which he be to operate and the temper and disposition of his troop be no doubt very correct in the tactic which he adopt So likewise in regard to every military operation unless you know exactly the nature of the ground on which the general be to operate and unless you can count exactly upon the force which he have at command and likewise upon the state and temper of his army it be impossible for you to judge accurately with respect to the operation that be by him perform Now I say this because it be my intention only to state what be the operation which have be perform without make any comment upon them I have no doubt that they be perform with very great ability I have no doubt they be perform accord to the best that could be arrive at under the circumstance But I do not intend on this occasion to meet any objection which may be make a to any particular course of conduct take by our army on any particular day Now Sir let me proceed to state the position of Lord Raglan Lord Raglan be choose by Her Majesty to command the expedition which be send to the East That choice be dictate by the reflection of the service which he have already perform both in the army and in other capacity Lord Raglan when he be a young man might under the influence of a very powerful family connection have obtain any position he might have aspire to but the only thing he ask of the Government of that day be to be attach to the staff of Sir Arthur Wellesley He be attach to that staff and from that time every step that he have gain in rank in the army have be due to his merit and to his merit alone I remember him perfectly well upon several occasion when I have the honour of be at the of the Duke of Wellington in the Peninsula perform all the duty of military secretary to that great captain at a time when he have not only to conduct the military correspondence of the army but also the correspondence with the Government at home with the Secretary of State with the Secretary at War and with the Portuguese and Spanish Governments This be business amply sufficient to employ any office in this country which have the most business to perform and yet it be all perform by Lord Raglan owe to the clear head and facility of despatch which he possess amid the hurry of arm and that without for a moment allow his attention to be divert from his duty in the field After accompany the Duke of Wellington in his long career and be severely wound he be at length appoint to a position in the service in which he be call upon to perform other and more important duty to his country And if the character of the army of this country have be in any degree exalt and if the selection for promotion that have be make show how much desert have be attend to it be in a great degree to Lord Raglan that the country have be indebted for these result Such be the man therefore who be appoint by Her Majesty to command the army in the East and let me say far that have be so appoint he at once command the confidence and affection of the British army and in a very short time he obtain the entire confidence and the hearty of the general of our Ally the Emperor of the French When we have to consider that our operation be to be conduct in common and that they be to be conduct in common with the force of an ally with whom we have not be at all event accustom to in the field however intimate the alliance between the two Governments might have be during a period of peace the House and the country will see that it be not only by his decision and valour in the field and great valour be never display but that it be likewise by other and no less necessary quality that Lord Raglan have be of so much service to his country And now Sir I will proceed to that expedition and those contest in which some of the best blood of this country have be shed and when I say the best blood of this country I by no mean intend to refer to any particular rank military or social for I feel that among the best blood of this country be the blood of those son of labour who have enter the military profession have devote their whole heart to their duty men who have stand in the field of battle without the hope or expectation of be distinguish by those reward by which men in high station be often sway but who have perform their duty nobly reckless even of their life at the same time with a feeling of religious obligation that all must admire for while they have endure with the great firmness the assault of their enemy they have shrink with the utmost avoidance from commit the slight outrage upon any one I be confident that these child of the peasantry of England be of no less worth in blood and courage than the son of the high and the noble of the land The embarkation of the British troop take place towards the end of August In a despatch of the of that month Lord Raglan mention the that he think be due to the officer of the British navy of which I shall take notice hereafter when I come to that part of the Vote for the assistance they have give in order to effect the embarkation of so great a number of troop The expedition proceed to the Crimea There be some question with respect to the place of disembarkation Lord Raglan himself precede the fleet in a swift steamer survey the coast and find that some point which have be think of a for the troop be guard by numerous redoubt and fortification and at length fix upon a place for disembarkation to which he obtain the assent of Marshal the commander of the French army This selection be so judicious that the whole army be disembark without opposition and the important operation be effect safely and completely in the course of two day Here be already a proof of the skill of Lord Raglan which be calculate to give great satisfaction to this country Having land on the of September the army proceed and effect a march of considerable length on the On the of the month they march two mile far and find the Russian army on the height above the Alma they attack it and in the course of two hour make themselves master of those height the Russian army make no further attempt to retake and occupy that position It be a position well choose and of great natural strength so strong that the right of the Russian position Was quite unassailable from the precipitous nature of the ground and it be generally believe that Prince who there command say it be a position in which the allied army might be keep at bay for three week and be thereby prevent from proceed to the siege of Yet such be the brilliant valour of the British and French troop that they carry those height The Light Division of the British army have encounter a heavy shower of musketry and grape which for a time thin their rank the brigade of the Guards and the Highlanders come up and attack the position with such vigour and determination that the Russians yield the height never again to attempt their occupation I have already say that with regard to the detail of this action Lord Raglan have tell them in the clearest and full manner I may mention however some circumstance relate to that noble Lord himself Marshal carry at the same time the left of the Russian position The charge of the French be so impetuous and so vigorous that the Russians yield the ground and the French army be establish on the height which they bad occupy On the British side great mass of troop be collect Lord Raglan see the great force with which he have to contend desire an officer of his staff to go to a height which he point out and see if there be any chance of approach it with our gun The officer return and say he think it be possible and Lord Raglan immediately direct two gun to be carry to the height The Russian artillery be so powerful and so incessant that many of the artilleryman who man those gun be kill in ascend the height but the gun be place where Lord Raglan have desire and an officer of Isis own staff fire the first shot that be discharge from them They be not effective but presently they get the range and other shot be so well direct against the mass of the Russian infantry and make such chasm in their rank that after a time the whole mass begin to move the column be shake and the Russians compel to retreat This be a proof a I think conclusive of his skill a a general his see with so much accuracy in what point the enemy could be assail and direct with that coolness which belong to him and with that decision which be likewise his characteristic the mode in which the vast force of the enemy might be most successfully oppose While I speak of the coolness of Lord Raglan I may perhaps be permit to mention what have be name by an officer of his own staff that think he expose himself too much that he have go too far in advance a place where the Russian fire be exceedingly not and that the life of a commander ought not to be so risked one of his staff say to him that he think he be expose himself too much when Lord Raglan answer be Do speak to me now I be busy There be nothing of epigrammatic wit there be nothing perhaps of heroic sentiment in these word but they be the word of an English gentleman attentive to his duty and quite regardless of any danger while he be discharge it After the battle of the Alma the army halt for a time while both the military and the seaman of the fleet be employ in assist the wound in carry the wound to the ship and in bury the dead The English and French army then proceed and the river be cross without any difficulty the Russians have abandon all defence of that river but when they come to the they find on the course of that river certain work of defence which the Russians have construct to prevent the disembarkation of the military store of the allied force Great consultation be necessary when it be consider whether those work should be attack whether the army should proceed a have be originally intend to attack the north side of or whether some other course should not be take It be decide that instead of occupy themselves in reduce these work the army should at once and at all risk march across the wood to the south of and endeavour to make themselves master of That march be accomplish on the of September with great skill the army be expose of course to the danger of a flank attack while they be perform it but it be most successfully perform They seem to have surprise the Russian commander for the rearguard of the Russian force be meet on the right of between and that place The English and French army proceed without difficulty to make themselves master of the height and the country between and an operation which be perform with great skill and success But immediately after this operation Lord Raglan have to lament that the officer with whom he have with whom he have consult both a to the original decision upon the undertaking of the expedition the mean of embarkation and disembarkation and the fight of the Alma be so reduce by illness that he could no longer continue the command Marshal with that heroic spirit which distinguish him determine to persevere to the last in perform his duty to his Sovereign and his country He be determine that though in a few week perhaps in a few day nothing but his cold dust might remain that dust should not be without it laurel He retire from the field go on board the fleet and in a day afterwards expire We must all lament an officer who have show so much gallantry and so much heroism and with whom our own army have so much reason to be satisfied and we shall always acknowledge him a an officer who to the last day of his life have perform his duty I can not omit here the word in which Marshal spoke of the conduct of Lord Raglan at the battle of the Alma because they be word come from the chief of the army of another nation and which while they show the generosity of the writer at the same time worthily show the character of him who be the object of them The bravery of Lord Raglan write Marshal rival that of antiquity In the midst of cannon and musket shot he display a calmness which never leave him The command of the French army then fell into the hand of General and it be with great satisfaction I can state that both in previous concert and ever since he have have that command Lord Raglan and General have act together with the rivalry only who should best serve the common cause with no other rivalry with no specie of jealousy but each admiring and applaud the character and action of the other On the of September the army occupy the height in the neighbourhood of About ten day have elapse when after a full examination of the ground the impression of Sir John Burgoyne and other eminent officer but I mention Sir John Burgoyne because he be best qualify to give an opinion on the subject their impression be that the task would be far more difficult than have be suppose It have be imagine that the regular fortification of on the land side never have be perfect the allied army might have begin operation close to the town and destroy those defence they consider that with such artillery a they have the capture of the town might have be readily effect When I look back to the letter that be write at that time by various officer and transmit to u by our Ambassador at Constantinople I find a confident anticipation that would soon fall Sir John Burgoyne however on examine the ground find that a the hill where they part and fell towards open into wide ravine separate from each other the troop that be place on one part of a hill could not with those on the other he therefore find that it would be very difficult to carry on the operation in the way originally intend and that it would be dangerous above all to leave any part of the English force unsupported on such ground a I have describe this part of the neighbourhood of to be It be accordingly resolve to bring as much heavy artillery into the battery a could be bring and our soldier day after day and night after night labour with singular perseverance in order to place in position a sufficiently large amount of heavy gun to destroy the defence of the place But it be obvious that from the moment that determination that necessary be take the prospect become one of a very distant kind for the Russians have a great quantity of heavy artillery in have likewise all the gun of their large fleet which lay in the harbour and have a considerable garrison besides the crew of the ship and without count the population of would have a force equal to if not superior to that of the ally From that moment therefore the task become one of very great labour and difficulty but both on the French side and on the side of the British nothing be leave undone in order to hasten on the work and to open a formidable fire on the Russian fortification On the of October that fire be open and produce very considerable effect Many of the gun in the Russian battery be dismount and some of their work be for a time nearly destroy At the same time the fleet both English and French come near the fort towards the seaside and open a most formidable fire for some hour against those defence but that fire not have produce the effect of leave the place open to the immediate assault of the ally the Russians occupy the night always in repair the defence which have be destroy and in replace other gun a substitute for those which have be dismount In this manner therefore the siege go on till the of October when the Russians come round by the valley of the make an attack on our outpost at These redoubt be occupy by Turks and the Russians succeed in make themselves master of them They advance a great force of cavalry but the heavy cavalry of the British not regard their superiority of number attack them with great gallantry and force them to retire On the same day by the of an order that have be give by Lord Raglan an attack be make by the light cavalry upon the line of the Russians comprehend their battery of artillery which be guard by other battery in flank and by large body of infantry and cavalry Nothing could be more distinguished than the bravery of the British troop on this occasion I believe at no time in the annals of the British army have courage be more signally display We may lament the that occur we may lament the fruitless result of the action and that it do not produce the effect which under different circumstance it might have cause but that can not be the least disparagement to the valour of these men who be ready at any risk and with these immense odds against them to charge the enemy they saw before them and whom they be direct to attack The work of the siege continue those work be in themselves very laborious occupy a far more than ordinary proportion of the besieging force and the more fatiguing because a great portion of the men have be take away by sickness cholera have not yet cease in the camp of the ally It be in this state of thing that an immense effort be make by the commander of the Russian force perhaps I should rather say by the Emperor of Russia himself for two of his son be present in order to overwhelm the force of the ally which remain on the one side besiege a great fortified place with a numerous garrison and defend by a prodigious artillery and on the other confront by a Russian army That attempt be make it have be say by men but I think it probable that the number be not less than They be troop who have not be present at the battle of the Alma troop do not know the enemy they have to encounter These troop raise to the utmost pitch of fanaticism and it be say their courage animate by other mean come in vast column to the attack of the British position on the height of on the of November Lord Raglan have relate the event of that battle He have state how in the darkness of the night and in the fog of the morning the Russians be able to place a very large artillery force not less than ninety piece and to advance vast column close to the English position In that darkness and thickness of the fog it be impossible to exercise the power and the discrimination of a commander It be impossible to survey the field or to direct operation There be only about British soldier in that field but though their number be few though they have be weaken by sickness and battle though they present themselves rag from the labour and privation they have go through though and the darkness they could hardly recognise the companion and comrade of their own regiment though a great portion of them come after hour hard work in the trench though they have not time even to take a scanty meal before they meet this powerful enemy yet they retain unquenched and unquenchable the spirit of British soldier and that spirit bore them on to victory It be a my right Friend the Secretary at War truly say the other night the battle of the soldier But yet that band of hero expose a they be to an artillery against which nothing for a very long time could have stand might have be not drive from the field or defeat but might at last have be force to lay down their life on the height which the enemy in consequence of their overwhelming number might then have occupy have there not at this very moment arrive after the English have for hour withstand a most determined attack a reinforcement of our French Allies command by General one of the most distinguished chief in the French Army who direct with great skill and valour the troop he lead to the spot The French soldier rush on with such impetuosity that they save the day and preserve both army from disaster which might otherwise have overwhelm them have the Russians gain any part of the position and from that have be able to continue the attack against the Allied force Still include these French troop there be but men of the Allies engage in this famous action and I believe in respect to the destruction of the enemy scarcely any battle have be equal to it More than dead be leave on the field of battle by the Russians and it would be a moderate estimate to say that three time a many must have be wound so that these Allied troop cause a loss to the enemy of far more than their own number I believe Sir that no modern annals contain the history of a battle which redound more to the honour of those who gain it than the one I be now allude to It have cost indeed the loss of many a gallant man it have cause desolation and misery to many family but I be persuade that the renown of that battle will last and it effect will be appreciate for generation to come We have see that in the course of that battle there be many vicissitude of success but we have see that the heroism of those brave troop prevail and they who have to meet such troop they who have to give an account of what it be to attack such troop will be slow to think that Russia can ever gain the advantage in the war she be now wag against soldier so I will now advert only to the general operation of the siege and to the assistance we have receive from the Navy The general operation of the siege a I have state have be conduct by officer of great experience and have be of the most laborious kind The suffering and privation of our troop have be such a never before be equal and in allude to the loss we have sustain I can not omit mention one name the name of a general who fell at the battle of because from his character his talent and his former service the country have every reason to expect to see in him a complete military commander I allude to Sir George Possessed of great ability and of a high spirit he be so universally esteem that when the question of send out a Governor to the Cape upon some emergency arise that great military authority the Duke of Wellington concur in think that no more skilful commander and no wiser chief could be select than Sir George I remember witness last year after he have just return to this country from that important mission in which he have fulfil the expectation of his Sovereign and his country the joy and exultation with which he hail his good fortune in be at once appoint to a command in the Crimea To the last hour of his life to the last moment of his life accord to those who saw him that feeling of joy and exultation seem to have continue and he appear to have have no other ambition and no other wish than to devote his life to his country and to spend the last drop of his blood in her service Such be the men who do honour to this country and by this country the name of Sir George never will be forget Sir have say thus much with respect to the Army I now have to state that it will also be my duty to propose a Vote of Thanks to the Navy for their I have mention that Lord Raglan at the commencement of the operation say that the zeal and efficiency of the Navy in perform the service of embark and land the troop be beyond all praise and that from Admiral down to the low sailor there be exhibit the same zeal and the same eagerness to discharge the duty efficiently He notice especially the conduct of Sir Lyons In relate the Battle of the Alma and after express his deep feeling of gratitude to the officer and men of the Royal Navy he say in word which I think I ought to quote They watch the progress of the day with the most intense anxiety and a the best way of evince their participation in our success and their sympathy in the suffering of the wounded they never cease from the close of the battle till we leave the ground this morning to provide for the sick and wound and to carry them down to the beach a labour in which some of the officer oven volunteer to participate an act which I shall never cease to recollect with the warm thankfulness I mention no name fear I might omit some who ought to be speak of but none who be associate with u spar any exertion they could apply to so sacred a duty Sir Edmund Lyons who have charge of the whole be a always most prominent in render assistance and provide for emergency Thus it be that he speak of that distinguished officer who together with those men who so act be an honour to the profession to which he belong and from whom I trust we may expect in the course of the war in which we be now engage great and brilliant service A man of great ability in whatever duty he may be employ I scarcely ever meet with and his meritorious conduct be well know to his country After this operation Sir Edmund Lyons be again most forward in the operation at enter the harbour at the same time that Lord Raglan be descend upon that place and from that moment to the present he have be most prominent in render every assistance to the army After the fire against have commence Lord Raglan and General ask Admiral and to with the fire of their ship on the battery on the sea side This service be willingly undertaken The injury a I have say to the land battery be not such a to justify the troop in attempt an immediate assault and therefore the fire of the ship do not produce effect except for the time but have the army be able by their battery on shore to lay open the place a seem to have be expect then the diversion cause by the navy would have be most useful I believe that every officer engage on that service perform his duty most excellently and to the perfect satisfaction of his superior After move these vote I shall next venture to propose one of an unusual one perhaps without precedent but consider the feeling of the country one to which this House will no doubt readily agree I mean to propose a Vote of Thanks to General and to the French officer and men who have with Her Majesty force Sir such have be the feeling create by the gallant act perform by Englishmen and Frenchmen conjointly two manly nation that have always respect each other that I believe the bond of friendship thus form between two nation will not be easily dissever These two nation the most enlighten the most intelligent and the most spirited of Europe may well act in alliance together and give an example to the world of duty resolutely perform and of high principle adequately maintain Sir I likewise mean to propose a Vote lament the fate of those who have perish in these action and offer the expression of our condolence to the family of those brave men who have die in the service of the country I wish there be not a part of the task I have to perform which though I think I can not omit it I can not approach without some feeling of repugnance All the account we have receive from those who witness the battle of and there be some similar account with respect to the battle of the Alma but all those relate to the battle of state that when the officer and soldier of the allied army fell wound on the field of battle the Russians instead of take them prisoner bayonet these unfortunate men on the field Lord Raglan and General deem the introduction of such a practice so abhorrent from humanity and a departure from the usage of civilised warfare be of opinion that it ought not to pass unnoticed and consequently Lord Raglan order evidence to be take by the Judge Advocate on the spot witness officer and soldier be examine and they depose to have witness those act of barbarity on the part of the Russian soldier instigate a they think in some instance by Russian officer The commander of the ally send an officer with a flag of truce to Prince to represent the circumstance to him and to state that he felt quite convince that such act must have be commit against the Prince order and to express a hope that the Russian commander would take measure to prevent such barbarity in future I wish I could state that the answer of Prince express that horror which might have be expect from an officer in his at such inhuman act He state that it be not the custom of the Russian army to give no quarter but he add that the Russian troop might have be excite because a church have be sack by some detachment of the allied force It be say whether truly or not I do not know that a church have be enter by some of the allied soldier and have be sack but that that circumstance should be mention a any palliation of act so barbarous a I have allude to be I must say not to the credit of the Russian commander We all know what be the conduct of the French and English soldier towards each other when they meet in conflict on the of the last war We all know that in the Peninsula after a battle be over they would meet on the bank of the same stream with their off a the Duke of Richmond say help one another and converse together in the most friendly manner show that they mutually respect each other We all know that when a be see by the advance army whether English or French the troop approach scorn to fire on or capture a man stand alone but help him on with his knapsack they tell him to fall back on his own comrade Such action Sir be characteristic of civilised nation and in such a spirit one would have hop that this war in the nineteenth century would have be conduct The atrocity I have allude to show not certainly that any Russian General would order such cruel act to be commit not certainly that the great Sovereign of the Russian empire would countenance them but that the enemy we have to deal with if they should ever obtain a dominion over any great part of Europe would instead of civilise and improve not only destroy the art of peace but barbarise the practice of war I therefore trust for this among other reason that the cause of England and France may be triumphant believe that it be connect with all the best interest of civilisation with the progress of humanity and with the spread of real religion Men who have be thus excite by fanaticism a we know the Russians be previously to the Battle of who be call upon in the name of the Christian religion to take up arm and go into the field of battle be guilty within a few hour of act such a I have state Let u trust that the Government of Russia ashamed of these deed will take some mean to prevent their repetition Sir there be one thing far I have to say and that of a more agreeable nature to myself and with respect to which I trust I shall have the concurrence of this House It be say in reference to one of the victory gain in the course of the last war by that for his part he would rather have to celebrate a gallant feat of arm perform by the British army than the conquest of a whole archipelago of sugar island I be convince that that say of his be a spirited and wise a it be forcible and point It be in these thing that the life of a nation be see it be by action such a we have to commemorate that the spirit of a nation be maintain from age to age It be by battle and victory such a we have the glory to record in our history by battle such a the French have likewise to record in their annals it be by battle and victory such a those to which I have have to call the attention of the House that each nation owe it separate existence and it be such exploit that make each country ready to defend it independence at any cost We have be for year all of u the Parliament the people every class engage in speculation and practice connect with the progress of wealth the art machinery and improvement of peace and we have show that these study and that devotion to these pursuit have not in the least abate the courage which belong to the entire nation We have show whether English Scotch or Irish that a similar spirit animate the whole United Kingdom and that we be ready to peril in a just cause all that be most dear to men I say again Sir that the victory which have be gain in such a cause a the present and with such a spirit a the nation have show must not only redound to the fame and glory of the country for future generation but enable it to present itself to all a an object of regard respect and admiration to the whole world The noble Lord conclude by move the several Votes of Thanks which be identical with those move by the Puke of Newcastle in the House of Lords see DISRAELI Sir there have be occasion in the history of this country when Votes similar to these have be propose to the House when Members have enter into criticism upon the conduct of commander and the policy of Ministers but I be sure that however much we may venerate Parliamentary precedent the House must have sympathise with the noble Lord when he say that there would be no difference of opinion upon the Motion which he be about to submit to our notice Sir the noble Lord have treat the theme which he have introduce in a manner so entirely worthy of it interest that it would be unnecessary and unbecoming in me to enter into any detail of those action which recently command the admiration of the world But Sir I feel that I be express the opinion of all present when I say that this be no common war that will some day be cover with the mere dust of history I feel Sir that this be a war which will rank with those great struggle that produce not only historians but in time poet even to celebrate their lasting achievement like those famous deed of the Crusades hand down to the wonder and admiration of men and many of which have be accomplish in the memorable region where these great exploit be occur If I may for a moment allude to what seem to me a characteristic feature there be a singular completeness in this the first campaign of the allied army which have scarcely attract observation The campaign commences by the allied troop take by storm one of the most difficult position in the world an almost impregnable position and it conclude virtually two month after by the same force defend a similar position from a similar attack by an immense force Thus we see both in assault and in defence the same troop exhibit the same admirable and unequalled quality Between these almost epic event I ought not to forget there be a brilliant episode the fight of that be a feat of chivalry fiery with consummate courage and bright with flash valour and though I can not presume with the authority of the noble Lord to single out the name of great commander for the applause of the House of Commons I can not forget I can not refrain from call to your recollection that the two commander on that memorable occasion almost recently sit amongst u on these bench and that they I be sure will peculiarly value the sympathy of the colleague whom they have quit Sir the noble Lord have very properly say that it be not for u to criticise the tactic and the strategy of campaign but it be open to u to draw some moral conclusion from the great event which be occur around u and we may at least draw this conclusion from the war which have break out I think what have occur have show that the art of peace practise by a free people be not enervate I think that the deed to which the noble Lord have refer both of the commander and the common soldier have show that education have not a tendency to diminish but to refine and raise the standard of the martial character In these we may proudly recognise the might and prowess of a free and ancient people lead by their natural and chiefs These be all circumstance and condition which be favourable to our confidence in the progress of civilisation and flattering I hope to the consciousness of every Englishman Sir there be one point on which I could have wish that the noble Lord have also touch I know there be so many subject which he could not avoid touch that I share the admiration of the House at the completeness with which he appear to have master all his theme but when the noble Lord recall to our recollection the deed of admirable valour and of heroic conduct that have be achieve on the height of Alma and I could have wish that the noble Lord have also publicly recognise that the deed of heroism in this campaign have not be merely confine to the field of battle We ought to remember the precious life give to the pestilence of and to the inhospitable shore of the Black Sea these men in my opinion be animate by a heroic a spirit a those who have yield up their life amid the flash of artillery and the triumphant sound of trumpet No Sir language can not do justice to the endurance of our troop under the extreme and terrible privation which circumstance have oblige them to endure The high spirit of an English gentleman might have sustain him under circumstance which he could not have anticipate to encounter but the same proud patience have be find amongst the rank and file and it be these moral quality which have contribute as much a others apparently more brilliant to those great victory which we be now acknowledge Sir the noble Lord have take a wise and gracious course in combine with the Thanks which he be about to propose tonight to the British Army and Navy the Thanks also of the House of Commons to the army of our ally Sir that alliance which have now for some time prevail between the two great nation of France and England have in peace be productive of advantage but it be the test to which it have be put by recent circumstance which in my opinion will tend more than any other cause to confirm and consolidate that intimate union That alliance Sir be one which do not depend on dynasty and diplomacy It be one which have be sanction by name to which we all look up with respect or with feeling even of a high character The alliance between France and England be inaugurate by the imperial mind of Elizabeth and sanction by the profound sagacity of Cromwell It exist not more from feeling of mutual interest than from feeling of mutual respect and I believe that it will be maintain by a noble spirit of emulation Sir there be still another point upon which although with hesitation I will advert for a moment I be distrustful of my own ability to deal becomingly with a theme on which the noble Lord so well touch but nevertheless I feel that I must refer to it I be glad to hear from the noble Lord that he intend to propose a vote of condolence with the relative of those who have fall in this contest Sir we have already felt even in this chamber of public assembly how bitter have be the consequence of this war We can not throw our eye over the accustomed bench where we miss many gallant and genial face without feel our heart ache our spirit sadden and even our eye moisten But if that be our feel bore when we miss the long companion of our public life and labour what must be the anguish and desolation which now darken so many hearth Never Sir have the youthful blood of the country be so profusely lavish a it have be in this cause never have a great sacrifice be make and for end which more fully sanctify the sacrifice but we can hardly hope now in the greenness of the wound that even these recollection can serve a a source of solace Young woman who have become widow almost as soon a they have become wife mother who have lose not only their son but the brother of those son head of family who have see abruptly close all their hope of an hereditary line these be pang which even the consciousness of duty perform which even the lustre of glory win not easily or speedily alleviate and assuage But let u indulge at least in the hope in the conviction that the time will come when the proceeding of this evening may be to such person a source of consolation and when the memory of those who be depart may be mitigate by the recollection that their death be at least associate with imperishable deed with a noble cause and with a nation gratitude The right Gentleman conclude by second the Motion of the noble Lord LORD say unwilling a he be at all time to trespass upon the House he could not reconcile it to his feeling to refrain from express how cordially he be prepare to concur in the Motion which the noble Lord the President of the Council have make The noble Lord have allude to the time when he happen to be at the of the Duke of Wellington during the Peninsular war and to the opportunity which he have then of see how completely our present Commander in Chief in the Crimea perform all the various duty of the office which he then hold He be sorry to say for one reason at least that he but too well remember that time also but have also constantly see Lord Raglan by the side of his illustrious chief he rejoice to find that he have turn the lesson in the art of war which he have then receive to such good account He therefore hop it might be permit to him a one who have long know the noble Lord though not with any degree of intimacy a to induce a feeling of partiality in his mind but simply have learn to respect him for the manner in which he have discharge his public duty he hop it might be permit him to express the satisfaction which he felt at see the noble Lord place in a position of such eminence and that he have be enable to render service to the country of such a nature a to merit the Thanks of both Houses of Parliament It would ill become him after the speech of the noble Lord a speech which indeed comprehend everything necessary to be say on such an occasion to enter into any detail of the various matter to which the noble Lord have refer He be confident however numerous and however brilliant may have be the service which the army of this country have heretofore be call upon to perform there have be no British troop ever expose to great difficulty to great privation to great danger than those to which they be now about to vote the Thanks of the House He be anxious also to say that he think the House of Commons have good reason to be proud when it recollect how many of it own Members have share in the triumph which they be now acknowledge They have unfortunately lose some of those whom they have be in the habit of see on those bench while others be still preserve to them whom it be hop would long be able to continue their important service According to the rule of the House there could be but one Member who from his situation would be mention by name in this Vote he mean the and gallant Member for Westminster Sir De Lacy Evans The and gallant Member might be assure that whatever difference of opinion may exist in that House between the party sit opposite to him and himself they be not dispose less readily than those sit on the other side of the House to appreciate his distinguished service and that the proposal now before the House would be concur in by those on the Opposition bench with the same cordiality a it would be agree to by his near and dear friend But he must not forget that they be about to vote their Thanks likewise to the sister profession It would be presumptuous in him have no connection with the navy to say more than that it fully deserve their Thanks The British navy have do what it have always do render ready and efficient and support to the British army And quite sure he be that if the British army be ever engage in any operation however difficult the success of which depend on the efficient assistance of the sister service that that assistance would be render in the most ready zealous and meritorious manner He would only add one word in allusion to another vote which the noble Lord intend to propose that to the army of His Majesty the Emperor of the French Whether that Vote be usual or unusual whether it be sanction by precedent or not he be of opinion that the occasion fully justify the course which the Government propose to take and he should a fully and cordially concur in that Vote a in the other Votes which the noble Lord propose say that it have hitherto always be his misfortune to act in opposition to Her Majesty Government and therefore it be now some consolation to be able to rise and join his voice in that of the general expression of gratitude and admiration for our army As it have be his good fortune to be an of the heroic conduct and suffering of the army he should feel that he be almost neglect a duty if he do not express his cordial concurrence in this Vote The noble Lord have give the House a detailed account of the campaign from the time of the landing in the Crimea to the battle of and he trust that he might now be allow to mention to the House some few instance of individual heroism which have occur in the course of that campaign and which deserve especial notice No sooner have our troop set foot on the shore of the Crimea than spite of the difficulty and discouragement to which they have before be expose they show that they be make of the old British mettle They wish but for one thing to be lead against the enemy In the cavalry skirmish which take place on the day of the advance previous to the battle of the Alma Captain Maude of the Horse Artillery greatly distinguish himself and by the skilful management of his gun completely drive back the Russian cavalry On the following morning a sight which have scarcely be ever before witness by most of those there be present to the British army Those who reflect that the great number of the men who be about to be engage have never see war before tremble for the result The storming and capture of the nearly position of the Alma be an achievement of unexampled valour The combat on that day be worthily commence by the French troop and it be then that General first display those great military quality which have give him so high a reputation with both army The French soldier under the command of that gallant officer scale the almost inaccessible cliff on the left flank of the Russians and while they do so the left of the British advance on the centre and right flank These gallant men carry everything before them and in less than three hour the enemy be completely defeat and the position occupy While they pay a just tribute to the valour of the British and French troop he could not forget the service render by the British navy The representative of those who fight under Nelson unite like their predecessor the two great element of heroism the great courage combine with the great tenderness On the memorable day of the Alma though our sailor take no part in the action they do all in their power to succour and sympathise with those who fight and bleed in the common cause On the day follow the battle the ship of the inshore squadron send on shore their crew with hammock and before nightfall a large number of our wounded men be take on board the fleet After the celebrated flank march to on which he would not dwell the siege commence and then the conduct of men who from morn to night pass their time in the trench without food or shelter under a severe climate and at the same time expose to the heavy fire of the enemy exhibit instance of the noble fortitude and heroism He be sorry the noble Lord Lord John Russell have not allude to the first battle of that of the October because it be a remarkable example of a small number of men defeat with great loss a very large force entirely on account of the admirable mode in which they be handle This feat be due to the ability of General Sir De Lacy Evans who have thereby increase the high reputation which he previously enjoy in the British army On the opening of the attack upon on the October the army and navy display equal courage but his noble Friend have already speak of the gallant action of the army he would mention two signal instance of heroism which have occur in the navy It would be recollect that that gallant commander Sir Edmund Lyons bring his ship the Agamemnon within yard of such a mass of gun a be perhaps never before bring to bear upon any vessel and with only two foot of water under his vessel keel he receive from twelve in the day till nearly sunset almost the entire fire of the Russian batteries The depth of water in front of the battery not be know it be most important that sounding should be take in order to ascertain how near the Agamemnon could go to the shore Admiral Lyons therefore send for a young man name Ball in command of a small vessel use for transport and towing purpose and address him say Will you go in before me and sound and if you come out you shall have your commission The young man without hesitate a moment go on board of his ship and with the utmost calmness advance before the Agamemnon under the most terrific fire and have perform the service require of him with the utmost coolness escape untouched and report the result to the Admiral A feat of intrepid dare like this be scarcely excel in the annals of warfare and show that our navy be still a nursery of hero and he notice it in that House because it be an instance of the display of courage by an inferior officer which do not find it way into any official despatch Again during the action at one time Admiral Lyons think it necessary that some other ship should come in and take off part of the fire which be direct against the Agamemnon and with this object he make signal which unfortunately be not see by the fleet The Admiral have express his wish on the quarterdeck to communicate with some vessel of war his own nephew and this make the incident a more touching trait of heroism his own nephew at once volunteer to proceed in a small open boat to the Having obtain his uncle consent he go to that vessel amidst a most terrible fire and bring her to the side of the Agamemnon this gallant officer be Lieutenant Examples of this description show how the old spirit of the British Navy still survive and in further corroboration of this fact he would relate an anecdote which he think peculiarly characteristic of the British seaman and which be illustrative of the feeling with which Sir Edmund Lyons be regard by the men under his command Before the attack of the a report prevail that the Agamemnon be at would not go into action but that her commander be to take the charge of another steamer and lead the attack One day therefore Admiral Lyons be summon to the quarterdeck where he find the whole of his ship company assemble The man whom they have choose a their spokesman then advance and say that the ship company have muster together because they have hear that the Admiral be about to take the command of the squadron which be to attack the battery of but intend to lead in another ship and say this man speak for the ship company We think it very hard sir that have have all the work we should have none of the sport The gallant Admiral at once assure them that wherever he go there his ship company should go too The noble President of the Council in describe the affair of have omit an incident which be worthy of notice The House be aware that our light cavalry charge between two flank battery the one on it right and the other on it left and that before them be draw up he might almost say the Russian army cavalry artillery and infantry Our light cavalry fight their way under this terrific fire with a heroism and a courage that be hardly parallel but be terribly cut up by the battery on each flank and in especial by one on the left It should be remember that at this critical period a squadron of be order to attack the battery on the left and with an indomitable valour only equal by that of our own troop this small body of forty men advance against it under the deadly fire carry it and enable the survivor of our devoted band to come out of action and return to their tent Out of the forty who perform this service two officer and fourteen men be leave dead on the field And while upon the subject of the battle of he must touch upon a topic on which he would appeal to the House sense of justice to listen to him for an instant He allude to the conduct of the Turkish troop which have be most severely reflect on It be easy to cast blame upon others when we perhaps deserve it in some degree ourselves and although he admit the possibility of British troop be able to hold the redoubt which be occupy by the Turks for a long period than those troop do yet in order to correct the misrepresentation that have be make relative to this matter he beg leave to quote a passage from Lord Raglan despatch describe the action at in which his Lordship seem to justify the of these redoubt by the Turks Lord Raglan write The low range of height that run across the plain at the bottom of which the town be place be protect by four small redoubt hastily construct Three of these have gun in them and on a high hill in front of the village of in advance of our right flank be establish a work of somewhat more importance These several redoubt be garrison by Turkish troop no other force be at my disposal for their occupation The mean of defend the extensive position which have be occupy by the Turkish troop in the morning have prove wholly inadequate I deem it necessary in concurrence with General to withdraw from the low range of height and to concentrate our force which will be increase by a considerable body of seaman to be land from the ship under the authority of Admiral immediately in front of the narrow valley lead into and upon the precipitous height on our right thus afford a narrow line of defence In fact these redoubt be so hastily construct a to have be untenable The Cossacks jump their horse over them yet the Turks though unsupported do for some time defend them and although a he have say they might perhaps have be defend some short time longer no military authority would be of opinion that they could have be successfully hold for any considerable period He have felt it only due to the Turkish troop to make that explanation to the House He come now to the battle of which be indeed a it have be describe one of the most glorious victory ever record It would be recollect that General Sir De Lacy Evans mention in his despatch the name of three officer among whom be Lieutenant who bravely at the head of their picket hold their ground against an overwhelming mass of the enemy for nearly half an hour and that he also commend the bravery display by a sergeant name Sullivan Now in Lord Raglan despatch the name of the officer be specify but that of the sergeant be omit He know that this omission occur by reason of a rule in the service but he sincerely hop that there would be some relaxation of the strict usage in this respect in future At the second battle of the Russians advance against our position at daybreak in enormous mass Our Second Division at first have almost alone to resist this overwhelming force and yet regiment after regiment and company after company enter the field and remain there fight incessantly until their ammunition be exhaust and they be almost bear down by force of number at length General come to their assistance and he could not refrain from bear his testimony to the coolness and calm decision exhibit by that officer during this eventful day Halting his division at first out of fire he advance with his staff to examine the position of the enemy and then he send his troops quickly into action to the assistance of our men in a manner which decide the fortune of the fight The French troop then distinguish themselves beyond all praise He could not before he conclude help refer to one other point In the vessel which convey him homewards there be a large number of Frenchmen who have be wound in the battle of the Crimea Among them he saw many private and officer bear on their breast the order of the Legion of Honour and other order of merit which have be confer on them for their bravery As these men stand before him show the pride with which they regard the honour bestow on them he could not help feel a deep regret that we have not some similar mode of testify the country approval of such service It occur to him that there be men in our army who though but it rank and file would feel a proud of order of merit if give to them a the officer who command them could be It occur to him that men who return wound or disable to this country with order of merit on their breast would be more likely to have their future course in life beneficially shape and influence by sentiment of honour and of a just pride than men who be hastily or indiscriminately reward in the field by small pecuniary donation and gift of that kind and he therefore earnestly hop that some high mode would be adopt by the Government for acknowledge the prowess of our soldiery In conclusion allow him to say that he be one of those few who think the time have come when without question it political necessity and however great might be the sacrifice impose by a struggle of this character war be almost necessary for our national safety and our national honour There have be many who believe that the people of this country have relapse into a state of effeminacy that a long peace of fifty year duration have destroy that British spirit to which we owe our liberty and our high position in the scale of nation The recent event in the Crimea must however have dissipate all such gloomy apprehension the troop who fight at Alma though they have never see a battle before show that they possess the true British spirit Would that that great Captain who have be the noble to the true British soldier have be permit to tarry a little while long among u that he might have see that the British soldier have not degenerate The feeling with which he join in the Vote of that evening be greatly increase by the recollection that unite with the vote to the British army be a vote to the brave troop of our French ally and be trust that that friendship which have be cement between the two army in the field of battle might be still far foster by sentiment of mutual admiration confidence and respect and prove of last benefit to the civilised world say he wish to call the attention of the House to a practical point This be a commemoration not only of the living but of the dead It be impossible to forget how many eye have be close in death in the region of the Crimea He wish therefore to suggest to Her Majesty Government that they should take into their immediate consideration the position of the family of those British officer who have die in the When we ask the British officer to sacrifice his life for his country we make upon him a just demand But when by our army regulation we ask him to go forth for the defence of his country interest and to leave his family in a reduced position and in many case in absolute penury we ask more than a nation have a right to demand of any man He be aware of the difficulty with which case of the kind to which he refer be surround he know how the organisation of our army be mixed up with our social position but he be sure that Her Majesty Government would only be carry into effect the desire of the country if they at least repaid to the family of those officer who have fall or might fall in this war the regulation price of their commission His right Friend the Member for Buckinghamshire Disraeli have state that more than one case have occur of brother have fall in the present war He beg to call the attention of the House to a case in which two brother have fall at Those brother be officer in the same regiment and both of them there sacrifice their life for the honour of their country One of them have loft a widow with several child Those brother have invest the whole of their fortune and the one the great part of his wife fortune in the purchase of their commission so that this family to whom the nation be now turn thanks be leave with no other inheritance and no other mean of support but the contribution of the benevolent and the glory of the name which they bore This should not be He could assure his right Friend the Secretary at War that he could not do good than direct his attention to the case to which he have refer He trust that this country would not when next it have to return thanks to the officer of the British army be trouble with the disgraceful reflection that no effectual requital have be make to those family who have be ruin by the fall of their relative in the DRUMMOND Sir I be very glad to hear the tacit and rebuke communicate by the noble Lord in his admirable speech to those civilian who become critic upon subject and upon men be totally incompetent to form any opinion I can of my own experience give another illustration similar to that give by the noble Lord I remember at the close of the last war din one day with Sir George Murray Colonel Nugent and some other celebrate men be present Marshal have send the plan of the battle of Toulouse to Sir George Murray and he say I do think that we have get it right I wish you would correct it if it be not but it seem to me that the Duke of Wellington would never have make so false a move a he appear to have do I ask Sir George Murray whether he be right and in reply he say Yes but he do not know the moral character of the troop with which he have to deal The whole depend upon that and unless a general be inform of the circumstance which sway a commander mind he be incompetent to form a correct opinion upon the matter Now Sir I be glad to find something like a return to penitence upon the part of the Gentleman behind me who have just sit down for he think it necessary to vindicate the character of the calumniate Turks who be not only charge with run away from the enemy fire but also of help themselves to the dinner of the British officer and men I hope that the Member will go on in the spirit of justice I can only say to him nova I hope Sir that we shall hear no more of his imputation upon admiral I hope that we shall have no more imputation cast upon the personal courage of our admiral I hope Sir that we shall hear of no more instance of violated hospitality in a gentleman who take advantage of the kindness and the hospitality show him to write home anonymous attack upon the conduct of Admiral Go on No I be not go on I shall wait to hear speak in this House what have be write anonymously then I shall go on We have much Sir for which to thank our commander and men both in our army and navy We have above all to thank Admiral who despise the critique of men who be incompetent to form an opinion upon his conduct despise the bad advice of ignorant men despise Our own Special Reporters have preserve his fleet in such a condition that even though we be no longer the besieger but the besieged it be nevertheless in a position which be both safe and honourable Sir I hope I shall be allow to defend myself from the attack that have just be make upon me Order I know that I be out of order but still I think after the language that have fall from the Member near me Drummond that I may appeal to the indulgence of the House Sir no person regret more than I do myself the unfortunate circumstance that have occur I write a private letter a letter which I have not the remote idea would be publish Unfortunately however that letter be publish and it publication have cause me very great pain The letter be write on board of the ship of a gallant officer who receive me a he receive everybody with a kindness shall never forget I go to that gallant officer and tell him that my letter have unfortunately be make public and that if he be call upon a I conjecture he would be to ascertain the writer he be at liberty to give my name to Admiral Unfortunately in that letter I have refer to a private letter from Admiral which have be show to me by a gallant captain in the service of Her Majesty I address myself to that gallant captain and say As I have be guilty towards you of a breach of confidence in so far that part of the letter which you read in my presence have be publish in a letter to a friend of mine any reparation that you may ask and that be in my power to give I be willing to afford With regard to Admiral I far say Express to him also the deep regret I feel that a private letter should have be publish contain a charge which I would only have make in the House of Commons and not in a newspaper anonymously but that a the charge have be make the only reparation I can give him if he insist upon it be to reiterate that charge publicly give him the opportunity of meet it and that I be ready to do I have hop that Admiral friend would not have be indiscreet enough to accept this challenge Accusations such a that make by the Gentleman on my left Drummond have be heap on me but I have hold my peace I have say nothing but a the Gentleman have challenge me this evening I be ready in my place in this House if call upon to do so to substantiate the charge which my letter make to substantiate them from the despatch write by Members of the Government and on the evidence of those who have serve under Admiral and have witness his conduct in this campaign I say this with deep regret because I feel that the character of a British admiral be at stake yet the character of England and of the fleet of England be at stake likewise and a this insinuation of anonymous slander have now be throw out if Admiral friend dare me to do it I be ready to support the charge that I have make CAPTAIN say that after what have take place he have expect that some Member of the Government would have rise to vindicate the honour and character of Admiral He fear after what have transpire unless something be say to the contrary the present Vote might perhaps be take as merely a formal one He regret that the First Lord of the Admiralty have think it consistent with his duty not to say a single word in vindication of that distinguished Admiral who be now maintain the honour of his country and he Captain could not on the present occasion refrain from bear his testimony to the zeal ability and discretion that have in his opinion distinguish the conduct of that gallant Admiral SIR JAMES GRAHAM Sir I regret that the and gallant Member who have just speak could suppose that we have show the slight indifference to the charge make against Admiral The opinion of the Government upon the conduct of the gallant Admiral may be fairly draw from the Resolution that have be propose by my noble Friend the Lord President of the Council That Resolution contain an expression of thanks to Admiral for his efficient service in the war I do not think it at all necessary in the face of such a Resolution for any Member of the Government least of all myself to state in his place here and upon his own responsibility that he be of opinion the thanks of Parliament be due to that officer I be very sorry that any difference of opinion should have arise between two Members in respect to the peculiar merit of that officer I can only say that if the Member for Aylesbury should think it his duty to bring on the charge he have make against Admiral I shall take care to be in my place in this House to vindicate the character of that gallant officer I think the present moment a most unseemly one for interrupt the harmony of our proceeding by any such discussion SIR BARING Having be at one time at the head of the Admiralty and after the observation make by the gallant officer I beg to express a hope that the Member for Aylesbury will on good consideration not consider it necessary to proceed far in this matter but should he do so I be satisfied that any investigation into the conduct of the gallant Admiral will prove most honourable to him I can not omit this opportunity to point out to the House the painful position in which a man in command be place at the present time The Member for Aylesbury have state and I have no doubt correctly that his letter be publish without his sanction or by accident I have see other letter also which should never have be publish and which he fear have come through officer who ought to have know well But when one find that an officer in command serve his country at a distance be liable every moment to have the that be run about the small story current in a fleet send home and publish and take by the good people of England a the opinion of the whole service when the officer charge be at a great distance and utterly unable to defend himself and who if present would be by his duty prevent from do so I think it be become on this House at least to show that the party aggrieve must not suppose that he be at all prejudice by those story Sir I think that publish comment upon the conduct of our lead men at the seat of war have be carry to a great extent upon late occasion and indeed I be afraid to a most mischievous extent I be far from wish to have any check place upon these publication but if they be to be admit I must appeal to the justice of the House on behalf of our gallant officer and remind them that the great caution should be observe in comment upon the action of those who be serve their country abroad After what have fall from the right Baronet at the head of the Board of Admiralty I must express my regret at what have take place But with reference to what he have say of Admiral he would read a passage from a despatch of the Duke of Newcastle to Lord Raglan and see what be the language use by the Government themselves This be a question involve the reputation of Admiral but the question lie between him and the Government Now what be the sentence in the despatch Your Lordships cordial of the invaluable service render by Sir Lyons and the officer and seaman of the Royal Navy So that in acknowledge after a great battle the service of the British Navy the Government omit the name of the man in the chief command and mention the name of the second in command In the face of such evidence what right have you to say that I should never have make the charge The question be one that rest between the Admiral and the Government As I have already say I be ready to support the charge I have make I be indeed compel to do so for I have no other way of remove any charge that may be make against my honour than by substantiate the allegation I have make If the right Gentleman will press it I will attend in my place to make good the charge SIR GRAHAM Though it be not very regular I think it necessary to offer an explanation which I hope will be satisfactory to the House though it may not be to the Member for Aylesbury The Member have allude to a dispatch of the Duke of Newcastle in which special thanks be give to Sir Lyons and the officer of the navy Now those thanks have reference only to the landing of the troop at There be many trait in the character of Admiral which arc honourable and praiseworthy but if I should be call upon to mention a single trait for which he be peculiarly remarkable I should say it be the generosity with which Admiral while command the fleet have delegate the large power to Sir Lyons the second in command and have join in the full approbation of his distinguished conduct With reference to the present question Sir Edmund Lyons be select by Admiral to superintend the landing in the Crimea who concede to him the large power and it be to the trust so frankly confide that the success of the operation be mainly owe Lord Raglan especially bestow his commendation upon the operation of the fleet in connection with the landing and mention particularly the name of Sir Lyons And therefore it be that the special mention of Sir Edmund Lyons be make in the dispatch Without adopt the language of Lord Raglan I can only say I think it be somewhat hard for Admiral to be thus treat Having entrust to an officer the performance of this important duty I say I think it be somewhat hard that the thanks earn by Sir Edmund Lyons under such circumstance should be turn against Admiral An officer have be select to whom the gallant Admiral trust the performance of a certain duty the Government in speaking of that operation would not have be justify in mention the chief in command ADMIRAL Sir I trust I may be pardon if I offer a few observation at the present moment I be a naval officer and I must say I never felt more wound in my life than at hearing charge make against a gallant Admiral at a time when this House be assemble to record their thanks to the army and navy in the East be the high honour that could be confer upon the United Service for the heroic action they have perform Sir this honour be consider so great that it be hand down a a triumphant to the of those concern Good God I be wound to the quick at have live to hear such a charge against a gallant member of my profession a profession that have ever be my glory It would ill become me to stand up in defence of Admiral without the power of refute the charge make against him but I rejoice that the right Baronet the First Lord of the Admiralty have have the manliness and proper spirit to avow his readiness when suitably prefer in this House to meet them and vindicate the character of the gallant Admiral With regard to the observation of the Member for Aylesbury upon the letter write by the Admiralty in commendation of the service of Admiral Sir Edmund Lyons and of the officer and men under his order I will not allow that their Lordships meant for an instant to detract from the merit of Admiral but that they have in view at the time they write it the particular matter with reference to which they felt themselves call upon to pronounce that commendation As an act of justice to my dear relation Sir Edmund Lyons it be right I should state that I receive a letter from him about six week ago in which after address me merely in term of love he add these word I be indebted to my Commander in Chief for the perfect responsibility he have vest in my hand and I can not but ever feel in the performance of my duty that I carry with me that encouragement and support For Sir Edmund Lyons furthermore I can say that he would scorn to encircle his brow with a laurel at the cost of a brother officer I again assure the House that I be really distressed and wound at have live to see the hour that I should hear an Admiral of the British Navy stigmatise a a coward and I hope the House will pardon the warmth of the few word I have address to it CAPTAIN Perhaps the House will allow me to state that I receive a letter from my gallant friend Admiral just before the publication of the Letters from the maintop of the Agamemnon Even at that time my gallant friend be perfectly sensible of the unfair comment that be make upon him and in so express himself state that it be impossible for him to notice them He felt them deeply however and I have no doubt whatever that they be undeserved and I do say that it be cruel in the extreme at the present stage of our proceeding when we be about to vote our Thanks to the Army and Navy to pull in such a subject a this for the purpose of traduce the character of a gallant man a I believe him to be who be still absent on service If such comment a all our Admirals have be subject to during the recent naval campaign continue to be indulge in it be my firm opinion that the service of the navy will be greatly impaired and sustain irreparable injury I have no doubt they will be able to vindicate themselves in the most satisfactory way when the opportunity occur against all these comment But with respect to the instance cite by the Member for Aylesbury that Sir Edmund Lyons and the officer and men under him only be mention in the despatch from the Admiralty why nothing can be more obvious than that Admiral could not have be properly allude to on the occasion No commander in chief ever take upon himself a subordinate duty It be not Admiral duty therefore to go and land troop He would have be totally out of his place have he do so and you might as well ask Lord Raglan to take a detachment of his troop for the purpose of execute some special service which it be the duty of some other gallant officer under his order to perform It be always the custom of the service and right and proper it be that it should be so that the commander in chief should take some officer who be under his command send him on special service which though important be small a compare with the superintendence of the whole fleet Why be Lord Nelson detach from Lord Vincent fleet when he gain the battle of the Nile Because he be one of the act admiral under Lord Vincent and be therefore send on that particular service I can mention many other instance in which officer detach on a give duty have succeed in reap a rich harvest of reputation in which however the commander in chief could not participate by reason of the very position he occupy and this believe to be the case with my gallant friend the Commander in Chief of the Black Sea fleet I deeply regret this interruption to the unanimity of the Vote we have now before u and it be only just to recall to the recollection of the House the circumstance under which it occur Admiral name be not mention until the Member for Surrey Drummond rise in his place and bring an accusation of a most serious nature against my Friend the Member for Aylesbury to which my Friend reply It be not the Member for Aylesbury therefore who first introduce the name of Admiral into this discussion"

71869	"OBSERVATIONS. FIRST READING._1876"	"THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY in call attention to the expediency of make provision for the more effectual punishment of the subject of Native Princes in India who be guilty of the offence of slave trading and present a Bill upon the subject say My Lords the Bill of which I have give Notice be one of considerable importance and it object may be shortly explain but I must apologize for not bring it ward at an early period I postpone do so because I hop the Report of the Royal Commission on the Slave Circular might be in your Lordships hand before I introduce the Bill and that I might be certain that in the provision of the Bill there be nothing that require to be amend in consequence of that Report The case be this the slave trade on the coast of Africa have be point out by Livingstone to be in the hand of agent of British Indian subject This be not strictly correct It be in the hand to some degree of those who be under British rule but speak more exactly it be in the hand of the subject of Native Princes who be under the protection of the Queen Until lately it be believe that the law against the slave trade at Mozambique Zanzibar and other place in those sea apply a much against the subject of Native Princes of India a against those who be under the direct protection of Her Majesty But in the case of a the subject of the of be bring before the High Court of Bombay A charge of be prefer against him at the instance of the Consul at Zanzibar and it appear by the decision of Justice Gibbs that the Court have no legal power to try a subject of a Native Prince for offence against the English law and the result be that he be release Now this be an obvious failure of justice In the case of independent Princes negotiation might have be set on foot and the subject of those Princes might have be bind by Treaty between the Sultan of Zanzibar and the other Native Princes But we have bind the Native Princes in alliance with the Queen not to enter into Treaties with foreign Powers They have surrender their foreign relation into our hand and that remedy therefore be not practicable and it be necessary a you give them protection and undertake all the duty which fall to the Foreign Office with respect to their subject to undertake also the duty of punish them if they commit crime against the law The proposal of the Bill therefore be to remedy the defect which be discover by the of Justice Gibbs and to enact that the law against the slave trade we propose to limit it to that shall be enforceable in the High Court of Bombay against the subject of Princes in alliance with Her Majesty just in the same way a they be now enforceable against British subject Another defect which be bring to light by the I have refer to we also propose to remedy It turn out that there be no mean of take evidence by commission at the distant place where the offence be commit If a slave trader be discover at Zanzibar and send to Bombay for trial it be almost impossible to send with him the actual witness necessary to prove the case Some may be send but all can not In the case of British subject there be a law under which evidence can be take by commission and we propose to extend that law by the Bill to the case with which it deal Another power we propose to take which though it be not of very great importance I think it right to mention By the exist law all subject of the Queen commit those offence be try in the High Court of Bombay but only Native subject be try under the law of England The result be that the High Court of Bombay have to administer another law in the case of other subject of the Queen not come under the denomination of Native Indian subject I need not say that there be no difference in substance between the two law but there be difference of detail and inconvenience sometimes arise in the case of person guilty of the same offence but of different extraction They be try under two different law and the Court have to administer a law with which it be not familiar We propose that all subject of the Queen in custody in India and try for the offence of slave deal shall be try at Bombay under the Indian Criminal Code That Code be recite in the Bill and provision be make for it amendment should amendment be find necessary These may seem small provision to attach importance to but any person who have study the subject will know that it be necessary to remedy the defect I have point out If Africa be leave to herself the slave trade would very rapidly disappear The very want of civilization the very savagery which expose the population of that Continent to the ravage of the slave dealer would cure the evil by prevent the appearance of person of sufficient and and still to carry on those nefarious operation The great evil come from the fact of there be men of a high stage of civilization of Arab or Indian extraction possess of sufficient knowledge arm and organization to enable them to make victim of the helpless population of Africa If you reach those men of a superior civilization by the penalty of the law you will do more to stop the slave trade than you can in any other way and we who have under our rule directly or indirectly of Orientals furnish no small contingent of the capitalist if I may call them so by whom this traffic be carry on It be essential that the arm of the law should reach the crime they commit Especially after the which have be pronounce in Bombay there would be no security for the administration of the law for not only would you be expose to slave deal on the part of the subject of the Native Princes but it would be impossible to distinguish between those who have be bear on their soil and ours which would practically leave the traffic open to the whole of the Indian population There be one thing I ought to mention namely that the do his best to check his subject in these nefarious operation but the Court of Bombay be unable to give effect to his Proclamation on the subject I believe my Lords that if this measure be pass a great and beneficial advance will be make and that other Sovereigns and Chiefs will be lead to give u power to deal with their subject and that we shall come nearer and nearer to the object of deter from this traffic all those race whose superior civilization now enable them to engage in it The noble Marquess then present a Bill for more effectually punish offence against the law relate to the Slave Trade and move that it be now read the first time LORD STANLEY OF say he have no objection to the object of this Bill but unless the consent of the various Indian Sovereigns whose subject it be propose to punish by the Bill have be give the measure would propose to enact that which be contrary to the law of nation and an usurpation The Bill be apparently intend to operate against the Banyans who trade principally at and probably they belong to a very small number of States and the consent of their Rulers might easily be obtain and unless that consent be give this country have no right to inflict penalty on those subject and he would feel bound to offer all the opposition to it in his power EARL GRANVILLE observe that it would not be convenient at that stage to discuss the provision of the Bill From the information the noble Marquess have afford them he felt convinced that the inclination of the House would be to give the Government all the power they require to carry out the object they have in view"
